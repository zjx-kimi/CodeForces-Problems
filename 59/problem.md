## Description

<div><p>The caterpillar decided to visit every node of the tree. Initially, it is sitting at the root.</p><p>The tree is represented as a rooted tree with the root at the node $1$. Each crawl to a neighboring node takes $1$ minute for the caterpillar. </p><p>And there is a trampoline under the tree. If the caterpillar detaches from the tree and falls onto the trampoline, it will end up at the root of the tree in $0$ seconds. But the trampoline is old and can withstand no more than $k$ caterpillar's falls.</p><p>What is the minimum time the caterpillar can take to visit all the nodes of the tree?</p><p>More formally, we need to find the minimum time required to visit all the nodes of the tree, if the caterpillar starts at the root (node $1$) and moves using two methods.</p><ol> <li>  Crawl along an edge to one of the neighboring nodes: takes $1$ minute. </li><li>  Teleport to the root: takes no time,  no new nodes become visited. </li></ol><p>The second method (teleportation) can be used at most $k$ times. The caterpillar can finish the journey at any node.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains two integers: $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of nodes in the tree, and $k$ ($0 \le k \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the maximum number of teleports to the root.</p><p>The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2$, $p_3$, ..., $p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the ancestors in the tree for nodes $2, 3, \ldots, n$; node $1$ is the root.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single number in a single line&nbsp;— the minimum number of minutes required to visit all the nodes of the tree.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains two integers: $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of nodes in the tree, and $k$ ($0 \le k \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the maximum number of teleports to the root.</p><p>The second line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2$, $p_3$, ..., $p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the ancestors in the tree for nodes $2, 3, \ldots, n$; node $1$ is the root.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single number in a single line&nbsp;— the minimum number of minutes required to visit all the nodes of the tree.</p>
