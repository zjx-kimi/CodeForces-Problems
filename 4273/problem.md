## Description

<div><p>Alice lives on a flat planet that can be modeled as a square grid of size $n \times n$, with rows and columns enumerated from $1$ to $n$. We represent the cell at the intersection of row $r$ and column $c$ with ordered pair $(r, c)$. Each cell in the grid is either <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-it">water</span>.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://uPnrsatC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="265px"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">An example planet with $n = 5$. It also appears in the first sample test.</span> </center><p>Alice resides in <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span> cell $(r_1, c_1)$. She wishes to travel to <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span> cell $(r_2, c_2)$. At any moment, she may move to one of the cells adjacent to where she is—in one of the four directions (i.e., up, down, left, or right).</p><p>Unfortunately, Alice cannot swim, and there is no viable transportation means other than by foot (i.e., she can walk only on <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span>). As a result, Alice's trip may be impossible.</p><p>To help Alice, you plan to create <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at most one</span> tunnel between some two <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span> cells. The tunnel will allow Alice to freely travel between the two endpoints. Indeed, creating a tunnel is a lot of effort: the cost of creating a tunnel between cells $(r_s, c_s)$ and $(r_t, c_t)$ is $(r_s-r_t)^2 + (c_s-c_t)^2$.</p><p>For now, your task is to find the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $(r_1, c_1)$ to $(r_2, c_2)$. If no tunnel needs to be created, the cost is $0$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$) — the width of the square grid.</p><p>The second line contains two space-separated integers $r_1$ and $c_1$ ($1 \leq r_1, c_1 \leq n$) — denoting the cell where Alice resides.</p><p>The third line contains two space-separated integers $r_2$ and $c_2$ ($1 \leq r_2, c_2 \leq n$) — denoting the cell to which Alice wishes to travel.</p><p>Each of the following $n$ lines contains a string of $n$ characters.

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 50$) — the width of the square grid.</p><p>The second line contains two space-separated integers $r_1$ and $c_1$ ($1 \leq r_1, c_1 \leq n$) — denoting the cell where Alice resides.</p><p>The third line contains two space-separated integers $r_2$ and $c_2$ ($1 \leq r_2, c_2 \leq n$) — denoting the cell to which Alice wishes to travel.</p><p>Each of the following $n$ lines contains a string of $n$ characters. The $j$-th character of the $i$-th such line ($1 \leq i, j \leq n$) is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> if $(i, j)$ is <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> if $(i, j)$ is <span class="tex-font-style-it">water</span>.</p><p>It is guaranteed that $(r_1, c_1)$ and $(r_2, c_2)$ are <span class="tex-font-style-it">land</span>.</p>

## Output

<p>Print an integer that is the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $(r_1, c_1)$ to $(r_2, c_2)$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first sample, a tunnel between cells $(1, 4)$ and $(4, 5)$ should be created. The cost of doing so is $(1-4)^2 + (4-5)^2 = 10$, which is optimal. This way, Alice could walk from $(1, 1)$ to $(1, 4)$, use the tunnel from $(1, 4)$ to $(4, 5)$, and lastly walk from $(4, 5)$ to $(5, 5)$.</p><p>In the second sample, clearly a tunnel between cells $(1, 3)$ and $(3, 1)$ needs to be created. The cost of doing so is $(1-3)^2 + (3-1)^2 = 8$.</p>
