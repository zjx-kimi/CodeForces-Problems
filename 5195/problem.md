## Description

<div><p>You are given an undirected graph, consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The graph does not necessarily connected. Guaranteed, that the graph does not contain multiple edges (more than one edges between a pair of vertices) or loops (edges from a vertex to itself).</p><p>A cycle in a graph is called a simple, if it contains each own vertex exactly once. So simple cycle doesn't allow to visit a vertex more than once in a cycle.</p><p>Determine the edges, which belong to <span class="tex-font-style-it">exactly on one</span> simple cycle.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contain two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $0 \le m \le \min(n \cdot (n - 1) / 2, 100\,000))$ — the number of vertices and the number of edges.</p><p>Each of the following $m$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \neq v$) — the description of the edges.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In the first line print the number of edges, which belong to exactly one simple cycle.</p><p>In the second line print the indices of edges, which belong to exactly one simple cycle, in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">increasing</span> order. The edges are numbered from one in the same order as they are given in the input.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contain two integers $n$ and $m$ $(1 \le n \le 100\,000$, $0 \le m \le \min(n \cdot (n - 1) / 2, 100\,000))$ — the number of vertices and the number of edges.</p><p>Each of the following $m$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \neq v$) — the description of the edges.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line print the number of edges, which belong to exactly one simple cycle.</p><p>In the second line print the indices of edges, which belong to exactly one simple cycle, in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">increasing</span> order. The edges are numbered from one in the same order as they are given in the input.</p>
