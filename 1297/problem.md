## Description

<div><p>You have a sequence of $n$ colored blocks. The color of the $i$-th block is $c_i$, an integer between $1$ and $n$.</p><p>You will place the blocks down in sequence on an infinite coordinate grid in the following way. </p><ol> <li> Initially, you place block $1$ at $(0, 0)$. </li><li> For $2 \le i \le n$, if the $(i - 1)$-th block is placed at position $(x, y)$, then the $i$-th block can be placed at one of positions $(x + 1, y)$, $(x - 1, y)$, $(x, y + 1)$ (<span class="tex-font-style-bf">but not at position $(x, y - 1)$</span>), as long no previous block was placed at that position. </li></ol><p>A <span class="tex-font-style-it">tower</span> is formed by $s$ blocks such that they are placed at positions $(x, y), (x, y + 1), \ldots, (x, y + s - 1)$ for some position $(x, y)$ and integer $s$. The <span class="tex-font-style-it">size</span> of the tower is $s$, the number of blocks in it. A <span class="tex-font-style-it">tower of color $r$</span> is a tower such that all blocks in it have the color $r$.</p><p>For each color $r$ from $1$ to $n$, solve the following problem <span class="tex-font-style-bf">independently</span>: </p><ul> <li> Find the maximum size of a tower of color $r$ that you can form by placing down the blocks according to the rules. </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output $n$ integers. The $r$-th of them should be the maximum size of an tower of color $r$ you can form by following the given rules.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_n$ ($1 \le c_i \le n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output $n$ integers. The $r$-th of them should be the maximum size of an tower of color $r$ you can form by following the given rules. If you cannot form any tower of color $r$, the $r$-th integer should be $0$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, one of the possible ways to form a tower of color $1$ and size $3$ is: </p><ul> <li> place block $1$ at position $(0, 0)$; </li><li> place block $2$ to the right of block $1$, at position $(1, 0)$; </li><li> place block $3$ above block $2$, at position $(1, 1)$; </li><li> place block $4$ to the left of block $3$, at position $(0, 1)$; </li><li> place block $5$ to the left of block $4$, at position $(-1, 1)$; </li><li> place block $6$ above block $5$, at position $(-1, 2)$; </li><li> place block $7$ to the right of block $6$, at position $(0, 2)$. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://n1fbw1jH.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>The blocks at positions $(0, 0)$, $(0, 1)$, and $(0, 2)$ all have color $1$, forming an tower of size $3$.</p><p>In the second test case, note that the following placement is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not valid</span>, since you are not allowed to place block $6$ under block $5$:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://6zeYR8vS.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>It can be shown that it is impossible to form a tower of color $4$ and size $3$.</p>
