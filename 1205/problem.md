## Description

<div><p>Pak Chanek is traveling to Manado. It turns out that OSN (Indonesian National Scientific Olympiad) 2019 is being held. The contestants of OSN 2019 are currently lining up in a field to be photographed. The field is shaped like a grid of size $N \times 10^{100}$ with $N$ rows and $10^{100}$ columns. The rows are numbered from $1$ to $N$ from north to south, the columns are numbered from $1$ to $10^{100}$ from west to east. The tile in row $r$ and column $c$ is denoted as $(r,c)$.</p><p>There are $N$ provinces that participate in OSN 2019. Initially, each contestant who represents province $i$ stands in tile $(i, p)$ for each $p$ satisfying $L_i \leq p \leq R_i$. So, we can see that there are $R_i-L_i+1$ contestants who represent province $i$.</p><p>Pak Chanek has a variable $Z$ that is initially equal to $0$. In one operation, Pak Chanek can choose a row $i$ and a positive integer $k$. Then, Pak Chanek will do one of the two following possibilities: </p><ul> <li> Move all contestants in row $i$ exactly $k$ tiles to the west. In other words, a contestant who is in $(i, p)$ is moved to $(i, p-k)$. </li><li> Move all contestants in row $i$ exactly $k$ tiles to the east. In other words, a contestant who is in $(i, p)$ is moved to $(i, p+k)$. </li></ul><p>After each operation, the value of $Z$ will change into $Z \text{ OR } k$, with $\text{OR}$ being the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR">bitwise OR operation</a>. Note that Pak Chanek can do operations to the same row more than once. Also note that Pak Chanek is not allowed to move contestants out of the grid.</p><p>There are $Q$ questions. For the $j$-th question, you are given a positive integer $W_j$, Pak Chanek must do zero or more operations so that the final value of $Z$ is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly</span> $W_j$. Define $M$ as the biggest number such that after all operations, there is at least one <span class="tex-font-style-bf">column</span> that contains exactly $M$ contestants. For each question, you must find the biggest possible $M$ for all sequences of operations that can be done by Pak Chanek. Note that the operations done by Pak Chanek for one question do not carry over to other questions.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) — the number of rows in the grid and also the number of provinces that participate in OSN 2019.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $N$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ ($1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9$) describing the positions of the contestants who represent province $i$.</p><p>The next line contains a single integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$) — the number of questions.</p><p>The $j$-th of the next $Q$ lines contains a single integer $W_j$ ($1 \leq W_j \leq 10^9$) — the required final value of $Z$ for the $j$-th question.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output $Q$ lines, with the $j$-th line containing an integer that is the answer to the $j$-th question.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^5$) — the number of rows in the grid and also the number of provinces that participate in OSN 2019.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $N$ lines contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ ($1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq 10^9$) describing the positions of the contestants who represent province $i$.</p><p>The next line contains a single integer $Q$ ($1 \leq Q \leq 10^5$) — the number of questions.</p><p>The $j$-th of the next $Q$ lines contains a single integer $W_j$ ($1 \leq W_j \leq 10^9$) — the required final value of $Z$ for the $j$-th question.</p>

## Output

<p>Output $Q$ lines, with the $j$-th line containing an integer that is the answer to the $j$-th question.</p>

## Note

<p>For the $1$-st question, Pak Chanek can do the following operations to get $M=2$: </p><ul> <li> Move all contestants in row $2$ to the east by $4$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $0 \text{ OR } 4 = 4$. </li><li> Move all contestants in row $1$ to the east by $12$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $4 \text{ OR } 12 = 12$. </li></ul><p>Now, columns $14$ and $15$ each contains exactly $2$ contestants.</p><p>For the $2$-nd question, Pak Chanek can do the following operations to get $M=3$: </p><ul> <li> Move all contestants in row $3$ to the east by $4$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $0 \text{ OR } 4 = 4$. </li><li> Move all contestants in row $3$ to the west by $1$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $4 \text{ OR } 1 = 5$. </li><li> Move all contestants in row $1$ to the east by $5$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $5 \text{ OR } 5 = 5$. </li><li> Move all contestants in row $1$ to the east by $5$ tiles. $Z$ changes into $5 \text{ OR } 5 = 5$. </li></ul><p>Now, column $11$ contains exactly $3$ contestants.</p><p>The following is an illustration of the example operations for the $2$-nd question.</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://cnjbE5zh.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p>
