## Description

<div><p>A dragon curve is a self-similar fractal curve. In this problem, it is a curve that consists of straight-line segments of the same length connected at right angles. A simple way to construct a dragon curve is as follows: take a strip of paper, fold it in half $n$ times in the same direction, then partially unfold it such that the segments are joined at right angles. This is illustrated here:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://cJMNqnsh.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="567px"> </center><p>In this example, a dragon curve of order $3$ is constructed. In general, a dragon curve of a higher order will have a dragon curve of a lower order as its prefix. This allows us to define a dragon curve of infinite order, which is the limit of dragon curves of a finite order as the order approaches infinity.</p><p>Consider four dragon curves of infinite order. Each starts at the origin (the point $(0,0)$), and the length of each segment is $\sqrt2$. The first segments of the curves end at the points $(1,1)$, $(-1,1)$, $(-1,-1)$ and $(1,-1)$, respectively. The first turn of each curve is left (that is, the second segment of the first curve ends at the point $(0,2)$). In this case, every segment is a diagonal of an axis-aligned unit square with integer coordinates, and it can be proven that there is exactly one segment passing through every such square.</p><p>Given a point $(x,y)$, your task is to find on which of the four curves lies the segment passing through the square with the opposite corners at $(x,y)$ and $(x+1,y+1)$, as well as the position of that segment on that curve. The curves are numbered $1$ through $4$. Curve $1$ goes through $(1,1)$, $2$ through $(-1,1)$, $3$ through $(-1,-1)$, and $4$ through $(1,-1)$. The segments are numbered starting with $1$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1\le n\le2\cdot10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($-10^9\le x,y\le10^9$)&nbsp;— the coordinates.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, print a line containing two integers&nbsp;— the first is the index of the curve (an integer between $1$ and $4$, inclusive), and the second is the position on the curve (the first segment has the position&nbsp;$1$).</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1\le n\le2\cdot10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Each of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($-10^9\le x,y\le10^9$)&nbsp;— the coordinates.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a line containing two integers&nbsp;— the first is the index of the curve (an integer between $1$ and $4$, inclusive), and the second is the position on the curve (the first segment has the position&nbsp;$1$).</p>
