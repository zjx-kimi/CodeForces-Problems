## Description

<div><p>It seems like the year of 2013 came only yesterday. Do you know a curious fact? The year of 2013 is the first year after the old 1987 with only distinct digits.</p><p>Now you are suggested to solve the following problem: given a year number, find the minimum year number which is strictly larger than the given one and has only distinct digits.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The single line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> <span class="tex-span">(1000 ≤ <i>y</i> ≤ 9000)</span> — the year number.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The single line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> <span class="tex-span">(1000 ≤ <i>y</i> ≤ 9000)</span> — the year number.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer — the minimum year number that is strictly larger than <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> and all it's digits are distinct. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.</p>
