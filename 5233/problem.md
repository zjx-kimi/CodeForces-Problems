## Description

<div><p>The Resistance is trying to take control over as many planets of a particular solar system as possible. Princess Heidi is in charge of the fleet, and she must send ships to some planets in order to maximize the number of controlled planets.</p><p>The Galaxy contains <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> planets, connected by bidirectional hyperspace tunnels in such a way that there is a unique path between every pair of the planets.</p><p>A planet is controlled by the Resistance if there is a Resistance ship in its orbit, or if the planet lies on the shortest path between some two planets that have Resistance ships in their orbits.</p><p>Heidi has not yet made up her mind as to how many ships to use. Therefore, she is asking you to compute, for every <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i> = 1, 2, 3, ..., <i>N</i></span>, the maximum number of planets that can be controlled with a fleet consisting of <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> ships.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>) – the number of planets in the galaxy.</p><p>The next <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i> - 1</span> lines describe the hyperspace tunnels between the planets. Each of the <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i> - 1</span> lines contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>u</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>v</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> ≤ <i>N</i></span>) indicating that there is a bidirectional hyperspace tunnel between the planets <span class="tex-span"><i>u</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>v</i></span>. It is guaranteed that every two planets are connected by a path of tunnels, and that each tunnel connects a different pair of planets.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>On a single line, print <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> space-separated integers.

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>) – the number of planets in the galaxy.</p><p>The next <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i> - 1</span> lines describe the hyperspace tunnels between the planets. Each of the <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i> - 1</span> lines contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>u</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>v</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>u</i>, <i>v</i> ≤ <i>N</i></span>) indicating that there is a bidirectional hyperspace tunnel between the planets <span class="tex-span"><i>u</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>v</i></span>. It is guaranteed that every two planets are connected by a path of tunnels, and that each tunnel connects a different pair of planets.</p>

## Output

<p>On a single line, print <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> space-separated integers. The <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span>-th number should correspond to the maximum number of planets that can be controlled by the Resistance using a fleet of <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> ships.</p>

## Note

<p>Consider the first example. If <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i> = 1</span>, then Heidi can only send one ship to some planet and control it. However, for <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i> ≥ 2</span>, sending ships to planets 1 and 3 will allow the Resistance to control all planets.</p>
