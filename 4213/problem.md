## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree with vertices numerated from $1$ to $n$. A tree is a connected graph without cycles. A rooted tree has a special vertex named root.</p><p>Ancestors of the vertex $i$ are all vertices on the path from the root to the vertex $i$, except the vertex $i$ itself. The parent of the vertex $i$ is the nearest to the vertex $i$ ancestor of $i$. Each vertex is a child of its parent. In the given tree the parent of the vertex $i$ is the vertex $p_i$. For the root, the value $p_i$ is $-1$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://f4xW2nWw.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">An example of a tree with $n=8$, the root is vertex $5$. The parent of the vertex $2$ is vertex $3$, the parent of the vertex $1$ is vertex $5$. The ancestors of the vertex $6$ are vertices $4$ and $5$, the ancestors of the vertex $7$ are vertices $8$, $3$ and $5$</span> </center><p>You noticed that some vertices do not respect others. In particular, if $c_i = 1$, then the vertex $i$ does not respect any of its ancestors, and if $c_i = 0$, it respects all of them.</p><p>You decided to delete vertices from the tree one by one. On each step you select such a non-root vertex that it does not respect its parent and none of its children respects it. If there are several such vertices, you select the one with the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">smallest number</span>. When you delete this vertex $v$, all children of $v$ become connected with the parent of $v$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ccU1Jy39.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">An example of deletion of the vertex $7$.</span> </center><p>Once there are no vertices matching the criteria for deletion, you stop the process. Print the order in which you will delete the vertices. Note that this order is unique.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The next $n$ lines describe the tree: the $i$-th line contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, $0 \le c_i \le 1$), where $p_i$ is the parent of the vertex $i$, and $c_i = 0$, if the vertex $i$ respects its parents, and $c_i = 1$, if the vertex $i$ does not respect any of its parents. The root of the tree has $-1$ instead of the parent index, also, $c_i=0$ for the root. It is guaranteed that the values $p_i$ define a rooted tree with $n$ vertices.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In case there is at least one vertex to delete, print the only line containing the indices of the vertices you will delete in the order you delete them.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The next $n$ lines describe the tree: the $i$-th line contains two integers $p_i$ and $c_i$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, $0 \le c_i \le 1$), where $p_i$ is the parent of the vertex $i$, and $c_i = 0$, if the vertex $i$ respects its parents, and $c_i = 1$, if the vertex $i$ does not respect any of its parents. The root of the tree has $-1$ instead of the parent index, also, $c_i=0$ for the root. It is guaranteed that the values $p_i$ define a rooted tree with $n$ vertices.</p>

## Output

<p>In case there is at least one vertex to delete, print the only line containing the indices of the vertices you will delete in the order you delete them. Otherwise print a single integer $-1$.</p>

## Note

<p>The deletion process in the first example is as follows (see the picture below, the vertices with $c_i=1$ are in yellow):</p><ul> <li> first you will delete the vertex $1$, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (the vertex $2$) do not respect it, and $1$ is the smallest index among such vertices; </li><li> the vertex $2$ will be connected with the vertex $3$ after deletion; </li><li> then you will delete the vertex $2$, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (the only vertex $4$) do not respect it; </li><li> the vertex $4$ will be connected with the vertex $3$; </li><li> then you will delete the vertex $4$, because it does not respect ancestors and all its children (there are none) do not respect it (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuous_truth">vacuous truth</a>); </li><li> you will just delete the vertex $4$; </li><li> there are no more vertices to delete. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="227px" src="file://Qnb3rzj7.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="756px"> </center><p>In the second example you don't need to delete any vertex:</p><ul> <li> vertices $2$ and $3$ have children that respect them; </li><li> vertices $4$ and $5$ respect ancestors. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="227px" src="file://LPeYbIqA.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="227px"> </center><p>In the third example the tree will change this way:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="227px" src="file://IEKxAKHf.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="454px"> </center>
