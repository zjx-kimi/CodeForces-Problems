## Description

<div><p>At the foot of Liyushan Mountain, $n$ tents will be carefully arranged to provide accommodation for those who are willing to experience the joy of approaching nature, the tranquility of the night, and the bright starry sky.</p><p>The $i$-th tent is located at the point of $(x_i, y_i)$ and has a weight of $w_i$. A tent is <span class="tex-font-style-it">important</span> if and only if both $x_i$ and $y_i$ are even. You need to remove some tents such that for each remaining important tent $(x, y)$, there do not exist $3$ other tents $(x'_1, y'_1)$, $(x'_2, y'_2)$ and $(x'_3, y'_3)$ such that both conditions are true: </p><ol> <li> $|x'_j-x|, |y'_j - y|\leq 1$ for all $j \in \{1, 2, 3\}$, and </li><li> these four tents form a parallelogram (or a rectangle) and one of its sides is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">parallel to the $x$-axis</span>. </li></ol><p>Please maximize the sum of the weights of the tents that are <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not</span> removed. Print the maximum value.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 1\,000$), representing the number of tents.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $w_i$ ($-10^9\leq x_i,y_i \leq 10^9$, $1\leq w_i\leq 10^9$), representing the coordinate of the $i$-th tent and its weight. No two tents are located at the same point.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>A single integer — the maximum sum of the weights of the remaining tents.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1\leq n\leq 1\,000$), representing the number of tents.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $w_i$ ($-10^9\leq x_i,y_i \leq 10^9$, $1\leq w_i\leq 10^9$), representing the coordinate of the $i$-th tent and its weight. No two tents are located at the same point.</p>

## Output

<p>A single integer — the maximum sum of the weights of the remaining tents.</p>
