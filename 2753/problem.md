## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is the easy version of the problem. The only difference is that in this version $q=1$.

The $i$-th sheep has to write exactly $k$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">non-negative integers</span> with the sum $n_i$.</p><p>Strangely, sheep have superstitions about digits and believe that the digits $3$, $6$, and $9$ are lucky. To them, the fortune of a number depends on the decimal representation of the number; the fortune of a number is equal to the sum of fortunes of its digits, and the fortune of a digit depends on its value and position and can be described by the following table. For example, the number $319$ has fortune $F_{2} + 3F_{0}$. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://OxDwJUXG.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Each sheep wants to maximize the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">sum of fortune</span> among all its $k$ written integers.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 999999$): the number of numbers each sheep has to write. </p><p> The next line contains six integers $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$, $F_4$, $F_5$ ($1 \leq F_i \leq 10^9$): the fortune assigned to each digit. </p><p> The next line contains a single integer $q$ ($q = 1$): the number of sheep.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains a single integer $n_i$ ($1 \leq n_i \leq 999999$): the sum of numbers that $i$-th sheep has to write. In this version, there is only one line.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains the maximum sum of fortune of all numbers of the $i$-th sheep. In this version, you should print only one line.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, $57 = 9 + 9 + 39$. The three $9$'s contribute $1 \cdot 3$ and $3$ at the tens position contributes $2 \cdot 1$. Hence the sum of fortune is $11$.</p><p>In the second test case, $63 = 35 + 19 + 9$. The sum of fortune is $8$.</p>
