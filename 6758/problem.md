On the next turn another player does the same, then the first one and so on. The player with no cells to paint on his turn loses.</p><p>The professor have chosen the field size <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and allowed the student to choose to be the first or the second player in the game. What should the student choose to win the game? Both players play optimally.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line of the input contains one integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">18</sup></span>) — the size of the field.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output number <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>, if the player making the first turn wins when both players play optimally, otherwise print number <span class="tex-font-style-tt">2</span>.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line of the input contains one integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">18</sup></span>) — the size of the field.</p>

## Output

<p>Output number <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>, if the player making the first turn wins when both players play optimally, otherwise print number <span class="tex-font-style-tt">2</span>.</p>
