## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of scenes in the movie.</p><p>Then follows $n$ lines, the $i$-th of which containing a single non-empty string $s_i$ of length at most $3$, consisting of lowercase Latin letters.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if there is an awesome subsequence of $s$, or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise (case insensitive).</p>
