## Description

<div><p>Vasya has recently learned to type and log on to the Internet. He immediately entered a chat room and decided to say hello to everybody. Vasya typed the word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span>. It is considered that Vasya managed to say hello if several letters can be deleted from the typed word so that it resulted in the word "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">hello</span>". For example, if Vasya types the word "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">ahhellllloou</span>", it will be considered that he said hello, and if he types "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">hlelo</span>", it will be considered that Vasya got misunderstood and he didn't manage to say hello.
