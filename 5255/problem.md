## Description

<div><p>One very experienced problem writer decided to prepare a problem for April Fools Day contest. The task was very simple - given an arithmetic expression, return the result of evaluating this expression. However, looks like there is a bug in the reference solution...</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line of input data contains the arithmetic expression. The expression will contain between 2 and 10 operands, separated with arithmetic signs plus and/or minus.
