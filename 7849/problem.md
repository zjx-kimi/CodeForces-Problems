## Description

<div><p>Alice likes word "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">nineteen</span>" very much. She has a string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> and wants the string to contain as many such words as possible. For that reason she can rearrange the letters of the string.</p><p>For example, if she has string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">xiineteenppnnnewtnee</span>", she can get string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">x<span class="tex-font-style-bf">nineteen</span>pp<span class="tex-font-style-bf">nineteen</span>w</span>", containing (the occurrences marked) two such words. More formally, word "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">nineteen</span>" occurs in the string the number of times you can read it starting from some letter of the string. Of course, you shouldn't skip letters.</p><p>Help her to find the maximum number of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">nineteen</span>"s that she can get in her string.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a non-empty string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span>, consisting only of lowercase English letters. The length of string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> doesn't exceed 100.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer — the maximum number of "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">nineteen</span>"s that she can get in her string.</p></div>
