## Description

<div><p>You are given a qubit which is guaranteed to be either in <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://HewvAYBS.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> state or in <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://dZIAlS7c.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> state. </p><p>Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was a <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://awJS6ecC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> state or 1 if it was <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://mPYFRyFV.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> state. The state of the qubit after the operations does not matter.</p><p>Note that these states are not orthogonal, and thus can not be distinguished perfectly. In each test your solution will be called 1000 times, and your goal is to get a correct answer at least 80% of the times. In each test <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://LCLOiqk8.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> and <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://jIqVDNYZ.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> states will be provided with 50% probability.</p><p>You have to implement an operation which takes a qubit as an input and returns an integer. </p><p>Your code should have the following signature:</p><pre class="verbatim">namespace Solution {<br>    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;<br>    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;<br><br>    operation Solve (q : Qubit) : Int<br>    {<br>        body<br>        {<br>            // your code here<br>        }<br>    }<br>}</pre></div>
