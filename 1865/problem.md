## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ $(1\le t\le 10^4)$ — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ $(1\le n\le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of Keshi's friends.</p><p>The $i$-th of the following $n$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ $(0 \le a_i, b_i &lt; n)$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case print the maximum number of people Keshi can invite.</p>
