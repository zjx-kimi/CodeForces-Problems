## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. The root is vertex $1$. There is also a string $s$ denoting the color of each vertex: if $s_i = \texttt{B}$, then vertex $i$ is black, and if $s_i = \texttt{W}$, then vertex $i$ is white.</p><p>A subtree of the tree is called balanced if the number of white vertices equals the number of black vertices. Count the number of balanced subtrees.</p><p>A <span class="tex-font-style-it">tree</span> is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A <span class="tex-font-style-it">rooted tree</span> is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the <span class="tex-font-style-it">root</span>. In this problem, all trees have root $1$.</p><p>The tree is specified by an array of parents $a_2, \dots, a_n$ containing $n-1$ numbers: $a_i$ is the parent of the vertex with the number $i$ for all $i = 2, \dots, n$. The parent of a vertex $u$ is a vertex that is the next vertex on a simple path from $u$ to the root.</p><p>The <span class="tex-font-style-it">subtree</span> of a vertex $u$ is the set of all vertices that pass through $u$ on a simple path to the root. For example, in the picture below, $7$ is in the subtree of $3$ because the simple path $7 \to 5 \to 3 \to 1$ passes through $3$. Note that a vertex is included in its subtree, and the subtree of the root is the entire tree.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://uGNOQOA1.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> The picture shows the tree for $n=7$, $a=[1,1,2,3,3,5]$, and $s=\texttt{WBBWWBW}$. The subtree at the vertex $3$ is balanced. </center></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 4000$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n-1$ integers $a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i &lt; i$)&nbsp;— the parents of the vertices $2, \dots, n$.</p><p>The third line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of the characters $\texttt{B}$ and $\texttt{W}$&nbsp;— the coloring of the tree.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the number of balanced subtrees.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 4000$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n-1$ integers $a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i &lt; i$)&nbsp;— the parents of the vertices $2, \dots, n$.</p><p>The third line of each test case contains a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of the characters $\texttt{B}$ and $\texttt{W}$&nbsp;— the coloring of the tree.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the number of balanced subtrees.</p>

## Note

<p>The first test case is pictured in the statement. Only the subtrees at vertices $2$ and $3$ are balanced.</p><p>In the second test case, only the subtree at vertex $1$ is balanced.</p><p>In the third test case, only the subtrees at vertices $1$, $3$, $5$, and $7$ are balanced.</p>
