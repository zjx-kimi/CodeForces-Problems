## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;– the number of vertices of the tree.</p><p>Then $n-1$ lines follows, the $i$-th of which consisting of two space separated integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \leq u_i, v_i \leq n$) meaning that there is an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the given graph is tree. </p>

## Output

<p>Output a single line containing $n$ space separated integers $a_i$, where $a_i$ is the maximum size of an almost-$i$-uniform set.</p>

## Note

<p>Consider the first example. </p><ul> <li> The only maximum almost-$1$-uniform set is $\{1, 2, 3, 4\}$. </li><li> One of the maximum almost-$2$-uniform sets is or $\{2, 3, 5\}$, another one is $\{2, 3, 4\}$. </li><li> A maximum almost-$3$-uniform set is any pair of vertices on distance $3$. </li><li> Any single vertex is an almost-$k$-uniform set for $k \geq 1$. </li></ul><p>In the second sample there is an almost-$2$-uniform set of size $4$, and that is $\{2, 3, 5, 6\}$.</p>
