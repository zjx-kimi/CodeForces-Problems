## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$).</p><p>Then one line follows, containing $n$ integers $a_1 \le a_2 \le \ldots \le a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^7$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single line containing the minimum number of steps.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, we initially have a piece of size $1$, so all final pieces must have size $1$. The total number of steps is: $0 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10$.</p><p>In the second test case, we have just one piece, so we don't need to do anything, and the answer is $0$ steps.</p><p>In the third test case, one of the possible cut options is: $600,\ 900,\ (600 | 700),\ (1000 | 1000),\ (1000 | 1000 | 550)$. You can see this option in the picture below. The maximum piece has size $1000$, and it is less than $2$ times bigger than the minimum piece of size $550$. $4$ steps are done. We can show that it is the minimum possible number of steps.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://0uvCmpuv.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="680px"> </center>
