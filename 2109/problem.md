## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $c$ and $d$ $(0 \le c, d \le 10^9)$, which are William's favorite numbers and which he wants $a$ and $b$ to be transformed into.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case output a single number, which is the minimal number of operations which William would have to perform to make $a$ equal to $c$ and $b$ equal to $d$, or $-1$ if it is impossible to achieve this using the described operations.</p>

## Note

<p>Let us demonstrate one of the suboptimal ways of getting a pair $(3, 5)$:</p><ul> <li> Using an operation of the first type with $k=1$, the current pair would be equal to $(1, 1)$. </li><li> Using an operation of the third type with $k=8$, the current pair would be equal to $(-7, 9)$. </li><li> Using an operation of the second type with $k=7$, the current pair would be equal to $(0, 2)$. </li><li> Using an operation of the first type with $k=3$, the current pair would be equal to $(3, 5)$. </li></ul>
