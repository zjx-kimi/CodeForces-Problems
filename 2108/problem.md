## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 10^5)$ which is the total number of items in William's array.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^9)$ which are William's array.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case output the minimal number of operations needed or $-1$ if it is impossible to get the array to a state when no neighboring numbers have the same parity.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case the following sequence of operations would satisfy the requirements: </p><ol> <li> swap(2, 3). Array after performing the operation: $[6, 1, 6]$ </li></ol><p>In the second test case the array initially does not contain two neighboring items of the same parity.</p><p>In the third test case the following sequence of operations would satisfy the requirements: </p><ol> <li> swap(3, 4). Array after performing the operation: $[1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]$ </li><li> swap(2, 3). Array after performing the operation: $[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2]$ </li><li> swap(4, 5). Array after performing the operation: $[1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2]$ </li></ol><p>In the fourth test case it is impossible to satisfy the requirements.</p><p>In the fifth test case the following sequence of operations would satisfy the requirements: </p><ol> <li> swap(2, 3). Array after performing the operation: $[6, 3, 2, 4, 5, 1]$ </li><li> swap(4, 5). Array after performing the operation: $[6, 3, 2, 5, 4, 1]$ </li></ol>
