## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case consists of $9$ lines, each line consists of $9$ characters from $1$ to $9$ without any whitespaces — the correct solution of the sudoku puzzle.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print the answer — the initial field with <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at most</span> $9$ changed elements so that the obtained field is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">anti-sudoku</span>. If there are several solutions, you can print any. It is guaranteed that the answer exists.</p>
