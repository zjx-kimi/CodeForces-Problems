## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $N$ ($1 &lt; N \le 10^5$). Houses are numbered by consecutive integers $1, 2, \ldots, N$.</p><p>Then $N-1$ lines follow that describe the roads. Each line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le N$, $a \neq b$) denoting that there is a road connecting houses $a$ and $b$.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line output the smallest total length of the shortest paths in kilometers.</p><p>In the second line describe one valid assignment of the new houses with the smallest total length: $N$ space-separated distinct integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_N$. For each $i$, $v_i$ is the house number where the villager from the house $i$ should move ($v_i \neq i$). If there are several valid assignments, output any of those.</p>
