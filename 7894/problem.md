## Description

<div><p>Let $a$ and $b$ be two arrays of lengths $n$ and $m$, respectively, with no elements in common. We can define a new array $\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$ of length $n+m$ recursively as follows:</p><ul> <li> If one of the arrays is empty, the result is the other array. That is, $\mathrm{merge}(\emptyset,b)=b$ and $\mathrm{merge}(a,\emptyset)=a$. In particular, $\mathrm{merge}(\emptyset,\emptyset)=\emptyset$. </li><li> If both arrays are non-empty, and $a_1&lt;b_1$, then $\mathrm{merge}(a,b)=[a_1]+\mathrm{merge}([a_2,\ldots,a_n],b)$. That is, we delete the first element $a_1$ of $a$, merge the remaining arrays, then add $a_1$ to the beginning of the result. </li><li> If both arrays are non-empty, and $a_1&gt;b_1$, then $\mathrm{merge}(a,b)=[b_1]+\mathrm{merge}(a,[b_2,\ldots,b_m])$. That is, we delete the first element $b_1$ of $b$, merge the remaining arrays, then add $b_1$ to the beginning of the result. </li></ul><p>This algorithm has the nice property that if $a$ and $b$ are sorted, then $\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$ will also be sorted. For example, it is used as a subroutine in merge-sort. For this problem, however, we will consider the same procedure acting on non-sorted arrays as well. For example, if $a=[3,1]$ and $b=[2,4]$, then $\mathrm{merge}(a,b)=[2,3,1,4]$.</p><p>A permutation is an array consisting of $n$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ in arbitrary order. For example, $[2,3,1,5,4]$ is a permutation, but $[1,2,2]$ is not a permutation ($2$ appears twice in the array) and $[1,3,4]$ is also not a permutation ($n=3$ but there is $4$ in the array).</p><p>There is a permutation $p$ of length $2n$. Determine if there exist two arrays $a$ and $b$, each of length $n$ and with no elements in common, so that $p=\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases. Next $2t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 2000$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $2n$ integers $p_1,\ldots,p_{2n}$ ($1\le p_i\le 2n$). It is guaranteed that $p$ is a permutation.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2000$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if there exist arrays $a$, $b$, each of length $n$ and with no common elements, so that $p=\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$. Otherwise, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases. Next $2t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 2000$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $2n$ integers $p_1,\ldots,p_{2n}$ ($1\le p_i\le 2n$). It is guaranteed that $p$ is a permutation.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $2000$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if there exist arrays $a$, $b$, each of length $n$ and with no common elements, so that $p=\mathrm{merge}(a,b)$. Otherwise, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, $[2,3,1,4]=\mathrm{merge}([3,1],[2,4])$.</p><p>In the second test case, we can show that $[3,1,2,4]$ is not the merge of two arrays of length $2$.</p><p>In the third test case, $[3,2,6,1,5,7,8,4]=\mathrm{merge}([3,2,8,4],[6,1,5,7])$.</p><p>In the fourth test case, $[1,2,3,4,5,6]=\mathrm{merge}([1,3,6],[2,4,5])$, for example.</p>
