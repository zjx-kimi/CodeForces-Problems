There is an empty line before each test case.</p><p>Each test case consists of $8$ lines, each containing $8$ characters. Each of these characters is either '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>', '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">B</span>', or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>', denoting a red square, a blue square, and an unpainted square, respectively.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given field is obtained from a colorless one by drawing horizontal red rows and vertical blue columns.</p><p>At least one stripe is painted.</p>

## Note

<p>The first test case is pictured in the statement.</p><p>In the second test case, the first blue column is painted first, then the first and last red rows, and finally the last blue column. Since a blue stripe is painted last, the answer is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">B</span>.</p>
