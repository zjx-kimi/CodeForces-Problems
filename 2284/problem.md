## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^3$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 10^3, 1 \le m \le 10^9$), which are the total number of cells in the array and the number of iterations.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains a string of length $n$ made up of characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" and defines the initial state of the array. "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" means a cell is alive and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" means it is dead.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^4$.</p>

## Output

<p>In each test case output a string of length $n$, made up of characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" &nbsp;— the state of the array after $m$ iterations of evolution.</p>
