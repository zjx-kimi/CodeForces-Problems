## Description

<div><p>You have two integers $l$ and $r$. Find an integer $x$ which satisfies the conditions below:</p><ul> <li> $l \le x \le r$. </li><li> All digits of $x$ are different. </li></ul><p>If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 10^{5}$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>If an answer exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print $-1$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 10^{5}$).</p>

## Output

<p>If an answer exists, print any of them. Otherwise, print $-1$.</p>





```input1
121 130
```




```input2
98766 100000
```




```output1
123
```




```output2
-1
```



## Note

<p>In the first example, $123$ is one of the possible answers. However, $121$ can't be the answer, because there are multiple $1$s on different digits.</p><p>In the second example, there is no valid answer.</p>
