## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $2 \le k \le 3 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertical and horizontal streets and the number of persons.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($0 = x_1 &lt; x_2 &lt; \dots &lt; x_{n - 1} &lt; x_n = 10^6$)&nbsp;— the $x$-coordinates of vertical streets.</p><p>The third line contains $m$ integers $y_1, y_2, \dots, y_m$ ($0 = y_1 &lt; y_2 &lt; \dots &lt; y_{m - 1} &lt; y_m = 10^6$)&nbsp;— the $y$-coordinates of horizontal streets.</p><p>Next $k$ lines contains description of people. The $p$-th line contains two integers $x_p$ and $y_p$ ($0 \le x_p, y_p \le 10^6$; $x_p \in \{x_1, \dots, x_n\}$ or $y_p \in \{y_1, \dots, y_m\}$)&nbsp;— the coordinates of the $p$-th person.

## Note

<p>The second test case is pictured below: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://MTvNdmMq.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>For example, points $3$ and $4$ form an inconvenient pair, since the shortest path between them (shown red and equal to $7$) is greater than its Manhattan distance (equal to $5$).</p><p>Points $3$ and $5$ also form an inconvenient pair: the shortest path equal to $1000001$ (shown green) is greater than the Manhattan distance equal to $999999$.</p><p>But points $5$ and $9$ don't form an inconvenient pair, since the shortest path (shown purple) is equal to its Manhattan distance.</p>
