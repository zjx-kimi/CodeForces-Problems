## Description

<div><p>Polycarp has $n$ coins, the value of the $i$-th coin is $a_i$. Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins between his pockets, but he cannot put two coins with the same value into the same pocket.</p><p>For example, if Polycarp has got six coins represented as an array $a = [1, 2, 4, 3, 3, 2]$, he can distribute the coins into two pockets as follows: $[1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4]$.</p><p>Polycarp wants to distribute all the coins with the minimum number of used pockets. Help him to do that.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of coins.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — values of coins.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of coins.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — values of coins.</p>

## Output

<p>Print only one integer — the minimum number of pockets Polycarp needs to distribute all the coins so no two coins with the same value are put into the same pocket.</p>
