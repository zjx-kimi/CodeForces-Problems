## Description

<div><p>Monocarp plays a computer game. There are $n$ different sets of armor and $m$ different weapons in this game. If a character equips the $i$-th set of armor and wields the $j$-th weapon, their power is usually equal to $i + j$; but some combinations of armor and weapons synergize well. Formally, there is a list of $q$ ordered pairs, and if the pair $(i, j)$ belongs to this list, the power of the character equipped with the $i$-th set of armor and wielding the $j$-th weapon is not $i + j$, but $i + j + 1$.</p><p>Initially, Monocarp's character has got only the $1$-st armor set and the $1$-st weapon. Monocarp can obtain a new weapon or a new set of armor in one hour. If he wants to obtain the $k$-th armor set or the $k$-th weapon, he must possess a combination of an armor set and a weapon that gets his power to $k$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">or greater</span>. Of course, after Monocarp obtains a weapon or an armor set, he can use it to obtain new armor sets or weapons, but he can go with any of the older armor sets and/or weapons as well.</p><p>Monocarp wants to obtain the $n$-th armor set <span class="tex-font-style-bf">and</span> the $m$-th weapon. What is the minimum number of hours he has to spend on it? </p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of armor sets and the number of weapons, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains one integer $q$ ($0 \le q \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, nm)$) — the number of combinations that synergize well.</p><p>Then $q$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$; $1 \le b_i \le m$) meaning that the $a_i$-th armor set synergizes well with the $b_i$-th weapon. All pairs $(a_i, b_i)$ are distinct.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer — the minimum number of hours Monocarp has to spend to obtain <span class="tex-font-style-bf">both</span> the $n$-th armor set and the $m$-th weapon.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of armor sets and the number of weapons, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains one integer $q$ ($0 \le q \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, nm)$) — the number of combinations that synergize well.</p><p>Then $q$ lines follow, the $i$-th line contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$; $1 \le b_i \le m$) meaning that the $a_i$-th armor set synergizes well with the $b_i$-th weapon. All pairs $(a_i, b_i)$ are distinct.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer — the minimum number of hours Monocarp has to spend to obtain <span class="tex-font-style-bf">both</span> the $n$-th armor set and the $m$-th weapon.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, Monocarp can obtain the strongest armor set and the strongest weapon as follows:</p><ol> <li> Obtain the $2$-nd weapon using the $1$-st armor set and the $1$-st weapon; </li><li> Obtain the $3$-rd armor set using the $1$-st armor set and the $2$-nd weapon; </li><li> Obtain the $4$-th weapon using the $3$-rd armor set and the $2$-nd weapon. </li></ol><p>In the second example, Monocarp can obtain the strongest armor set and the strongest weapon as follows:</p><ol> <li> Obtain the $3$-rd armor set using the $1$-st armor set and the $1$-st weapon <span class="tex-font-style-bf">(they synergize well, so Monocarp's power is not $2$ but $3$)</span>; </li><li> Obtain the $4$-th weapon using the $3$-rd armor set and the $1$-st weapon. </li></ol>
