## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is the hard version of the problem. The difference between the versions is the constraint on $n$ and the required number of operations. You can make hacks only if all versions of the problem are solved.</span></p><p>There are two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$ (a binary string is a string consisting of symbols $0$ and $1$). In an operation, you select a prefix of $a$, and simultaneously invert the bits in the prefix ($0$ changes to $1$ and $1$ changes to $0$) and reverse the order of the bits in the prefix.</p><p>For example, if $a=001011$ and you select the prefix of length $3$, it becomes $011011$. Then if you select the entire string, it becomes $001001$.</p><p>Your task is to transform the string $a$ into $b$ in at most $2n$ operations. It can be proved that it is always possible.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases. Next $3t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$) &nbsp;— the length of the binary strings.</p><p>The next two lines contain two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output an integer $k$ ($0\le k\le 2n$), followed by $k$ integers $p_1,\ldots,p_k$ ($1\le p_i\le n$). Here $k$ is the number of operations you use and $p_i$ is the length of the prefix you flip in the $i$-th operation.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases. Next $3t$ lines contain descriptions of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 10^5$) &nbsp;— the length of the binary strings.</p><p>The next two lines contain two binary strings $a$ and $b$ of length $n$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output an integer $k$ ($0\le k\le 2n$), followed by $k$ integers $p_1,\ldots,p_k$ ($1\le p_i\le n$). Here $k$ is the number of operations you use and $p_i$ is the length of the prefix you flip in the $i$-th operation.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, we have $01\to 11\to 00\to 10$.</p><p>In the second test case, we have $01011\to 00101\to 11101\to 01000\to 10100\to 00100\to 11100$.</p><p>In the third test case, the strings are already the same. Another solution is to flip the prefix of length $2$, which will leave $a$ unchanged.</p>
