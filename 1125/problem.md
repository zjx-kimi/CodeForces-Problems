## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is an interactive problem</span>.</p><p>Given a simple undirected graph with $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$, your task is to color all the vertices such that for every color $c$, the following conditions hold: </p><ol> <li> The set of vertices with color $c$ is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">connected</span>; </li><li> $s_c \leq n_c^2$, where $n_c$ is the number of vertices with color $c$, and $s_c$ is the sum of degrees of vertices with color $c$. </li></ol> It can be shown that there always exists a way to color all the vertices such that the above conditions hold. <p>Initially, you are only given the number $n$ of vertices and the degree of each vertex. </p><p>In each query, you can choose a vertex $u$. As a response, you will be given the $k$-th edge incident to $u$, if this is the $k$-th query on vertex $u$. </p><p>You are allowed to make <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at most $n$ queries</span>.</p><p>An undirected graph is simple if it does not contain multiple edges or self-loops.</p><p>The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to it. </p><p>A set $S$ of vertices is connected if for every two different vertices $u, v \in S$, there is a path, which only passes through vertices in $S$, that connects $u$ and $v$. That is, there is a sequence of edges $(u_1, v_1), (u_2, v_2), \dots, (u_k, v_k)$ with $k \geq 1$ such that </p><ol> <li> $u_1 = u$, $v_k = v$, and $v_i = u_{i+1}$ for every $1 \leq i &lt; k$; and </li><li> $u_k \in S$ and $v_k \in S$ for every $1 \leq i \leq k$. </li></ol> Especially, a set containing only one vertex is connected. </div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) â€” the number of test cases. The following lines contain the description and the interactive section of each test case.</p><p>For each test case, you begin the interaction by reading an integer $n$ ($1\le n \le 1000$) in the first line, indicating the number of vertices in the graph.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $d_1, d_2, \dots, d_n$ ($0 \leq d_i \leq n - 1$), where $d_i$ is the degree of vertex $i$. </p><p>To make a query on vertex $u$ ($1 \leq u \leq n$), you should output </p><ul> <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">?</span> $u$" </li></ul> in a separate line. If this is the $k$-th query on vertex $u$, vertex $e_{u, k}$ will be given in the next separate line, where $\left(u, e_{u, k}\right)$ is the $k$-th edge incident to vertex $u$. In case of $k &gt; d_u$, define $e_{u, k} = -1$. You should make <span class="tex-font-style-bf">no more than $n$</span> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">?</span>" queries.<p>To give the answer, you should output </p><ul> <li> "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">!</span> $c_1$ $c_2$ $\dots$ $c_n$" </li></ul> in a separate line, where $c_i$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq n$) is the color of vertex $i$. After that, your program should continue to the next test case, or terminate if this is the last test case. <p>It is guaranteed that the graph is a simple undirected graph.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $1000$.</p><p>In case your query format is invalid, or you have made more than $n$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">?</span>" queries, you will receive <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Wrong Answer</span> verdict. </p><p>After printing a query, do not forget to output end of line and flush the output.

## Note

<p>In the example, there is only one test case. </p><p>In the test case, there are $n = 5$ vertices with vertices $1, 2, 3, 4$ of degree $2$ and vertex $5$ of degree $0$. It is obvious that vertex $5$ is isolated, i.e., it does not connect to any other vertices. </p><p>A possible interaction is shown in the sample input and output, where $4$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">?</span>" queries are made on vertex $1$ twice and vertex $3$ twice. According to the responses to these queries, we know that each of vertex $1$ and vertex $3$ connects to two vertices $2$ and $4$. </p><p>A possible solution is shown in the sample output, where vertex $1$ and vertex $2$ are colored by $1$, vertex $3$ and vertex $4$ are colored by $2$, and vertex $5$ is colored by $3$. It can be seen that this solution satisfies the required conditions as follows. </p><ul> <li> For color $c = 1$, vertex $1$ and vertex $2$ are connected. Moreover, $n_1 = 2$ and $s_1 = d_1 + d_2 = 2 + 2 = 4 \leq n_1^2 = 2^2 = 4$; </li><li> For color $c = 2$, vertex $3$ and vertex $4$ are connected. Moreover, $n_2 = 2$ and $s_2 = d_3 + d_4 = 2 + 2 = 4 \leq n_2^2 = 2^2 = 4$; </li><li> For color $c = 3$, there is only one vertex (vertex $5$) colored by $3$. Moreover, $n_3 = 1$ and $s_3 = d_5 = 0 \leq n_3^2 = 1^2 = 1$. </li></ul>
