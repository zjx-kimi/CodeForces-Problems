## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the length of the number $c$ and the number of updates.</p><p>The second line contains a string $c$, consisting of exactly $n$ digits from $0$ to $9$.</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $d$ ($1 \le x \le n$, $0 \le d \le 9$)&nbsp;— the descriptions of updates.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $m$ integers&nbsp;— the $i$-th value should be equal to the number of pairs $(a, b)$ such that both $a$ and $b$ are non-negative integers and the result of a <span class="tex-font-style-it">strange addition</span> of $a$ and $b$ is equal to $c$ after $i$ updates are applied.</p><p>Note that the numbers of pairs can be quite large, so print them modulo $998244353$.</p>

## Note

<p>After the first update $c$ is equal to $14$. The pairs that sum up to $14$ are: $(0, 14)$, $(1, 13)$, $(2, 12)$, $(3, 11)$, $(4, 10)$, $(5, 9)$, $(6, 8)$, $(7, 7)$, $(8, 6)$, $(9, 5)$, $(10, 4)$, $(11, 3)$, $(12, 2)$, $(13, 1)$, $(14, 0)$.</p><p>After the second update $c$ is equal to $11$.</p><p>After the third update $c$ is equal to $01$.</p>
