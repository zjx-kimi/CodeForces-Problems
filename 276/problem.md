## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Background</span> </p><p>Extended reality (XR) service is a promising application for future communications. In wireless communications, XR data are transmitted over radio between base stations and mobile terminals. A region is usually divided into multiple cells, each of which is equipped with a base station to serve users. One base station usually serves multiple users, and multiple base stations may serve one user at the same time.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Task</span></p><p>The task of this competition is to design a scheduling algorithm for XR service. By properly allocating radio resources, we want to maximize the number of XR data frames that are successfully transmitted. A diagram is provided below for illustration: The transmission of a data frame is failed when it cannot be completely transmitted during the permitted transmission time window. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://rAukGp12.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small"></span> </center><p>Therefore, the objective of this task can be modeled as: $$ \mathcal{P}: \max \sum_j f_j \tag{1} $$ $$ f_j=\left\{\begin{array}{c} 1, g_j \geq T B S_j \\ 0, g_j&lt; T B S_j \end{array}\right. \tag{2} $$ Here, $f_j$ represents the transmission result of the $j$-th frame: when the actual transmitted bits $g_j$ (computed via (5)) is not less than the size of the frame, i.e., $TBS_j$ (transport block size), the frame would be successfully transmitted so that $f_j=1$. Otherwise, $f_j=0$.</p><p>To achieve better user experience, scheduling algorithm should be proposed to efficiently assign the limited radio resources: </p><ul> <li> Time domain resource, which is divided into several transmission time intervals (TTIs), each TTI corresponds to a transmission time of $0.5$ms. </li><li> Frequency domain resource, which is divided into several resource block groups (Resource Block Group, RBG), each RBG corresponds to a transmission bandwidth of $5760$ kHz. </li><li> Power domain resource: each cell has a fixed maximum transmission power to serve users. </li></ul><p>Summarily, two optimization variables are introduced to represent the scheduling result: $$ b_{r n t}^{(k)} \in\{0,1\} \tag{3} $$ $$ p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \geq 0 , \quad \sum_r \sum_n p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \leq R, \quad \sum_n p_{ {rnt }}^{(k)} \leq 4 \tag{4} $$ Here, $b_{rnt}^{(k)}$ is a Boolean variable denoting whether the $r$-th RBG of cell $k$ is allocated to user $n$ at TTI $t$, and $p_{rnt}^{(k)}$ is a nonnegative continuous variable denoting the power allocated to user $n$ in the $r$-th RBG of cell $k$ at TTI $t$. For each TTI of each cell, the power range of each RBG is between $0$ and $4$, and the total power of all RBGs can not be larger than $R$.</p><p>When the radio resources are allocated to the users, the XR data transmission can be provided for them. Assume that the $j$-th frame belongs to the $n$-th user, the actual transmitted bits for the frame, i.e., $g_j$ can be given by:</p><p>$$ g_{j}= W\times \sum_{t=t_{0, j}}^{t_{1, j}} \sum_k \sum_r b_{r n t}^{(k)} \times \log _2\left(1+s_{n t}^{(k)}\right). \tag{5} $$ Note that $W\times \mathrm{log}_2 (1+s_{nt}^{(k)} ) $ is the well-known Shannon formula, which represents the transmitted data volume, where $s_{nt}^{(k)}$ represents the transmission SINR (Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio) of user $n$ in cell $k$ at TTI $t$, and $W=192$ is the constant number of available frequency resounce elements of one RBG. $t_{0,j}$ and $t_{1,j}$ denote the start TTI and the end TTI of frame $j$, respectively. The physical meaning of Formula (5) is that the number of bits transmitted within the valid time period, $t_{0,j}\sim t_{1,j}$, will be counted as valid transmission bits for the $j$-th frame. </p><p>Finally, we give the expression of SINR, which may be complicated but corresponds to the actual physical transmission:</p><p>$$ s_{nt}^{\left( k \right)} = {\left( {\prod\limits_{r,b_{rnt}^{\left( k \right)} = 1} {s_{rnt}^{\left( k \right)}} } \right)^{\frac{1}{{\sum\nolimits_r {b_{rnt}^{\left( k \right)}} }}}} \tag{6} $$ $$ s_{r n t}^{(k)}=\frac{s_{0, r n t}^{(k)} \times p_{r n t}^{(k)} \times \prod_{m \neq n} e^{d^{(k)}_{mrn} \times b_{r m t}^{(k)}}}{1+\sum_{k^{\prime} \neq k, n^{\prime} \neq n} s_{0, r n t}^{(k^{\prime})} \times p_{r n^{\prime} t}^{\left(k^{\prime}\right)} \times e^{-d^{(k^{\prime})}_{n^{\prime}rn}}} \tag{7} $$</p><p>Formula (6) shows the computation of user-level effective SINR: the transmission SINR of user $n$, i.e., $s_{nt}^{(k)}$, is the geometric mean of the SINRs of scheduled RBGs. Then, formula (7) shows the computation of RBG-level effective SINR. $s_{0,rnt}^{(k)}$ is a given constant denoting the initial SINR on RBG $r$ of cell $k$ at TTI $t$, which indicates the quality of the channel. Another given constant value $d^{(k)}_{mrn}$ represents the interference factor between user $m$ and user $n$ on RBG $r$, when user $m$ is scheduled on cell $k$. Note that $d^{(k)}_{mrn}=d^{(k)}_{nrm}\le 0$, which reveals that scheduling multiple users on the same RBG-TTI resource will cause a decrease in the SINR of each user.</p><p>To sum up, participants are required to find an efficient radio resource allocation, so that more XR data frames can be successfully transmitted.</p><p> </p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The input of a single test has $(4 + R \cdot K \cdot T + N \cdot R \cdot K + 1 + J)$ lines, which contains user number $N$, cell number $K$, TTI number $T$, RBG number $R$, initial SINRs $s_{0, r n t}^{(k)}$, interference factors $d_{mrn}$, frame number $J$ and information about $J$ frames. </p><p>The details are as follows: </p><ul> <li> Line $1$: User number $N$, integer, $1 \leq N \leq 100$.
