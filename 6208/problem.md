## Description

<div><p>Student Arseny likes to plan his life for <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> days ahead. He visits a canteen every day and he has already decided what he will order in each of the following <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> days. Prices in the canteen do not change and that means Arseny will spend <span class="tex-span"><i>c</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> rubles during the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th day.</p><p>There are <span class="tex-span">1</span>-ruble coins and <span class="tex-span">100</span>-ruble notes in circulation. At this moment, Arseny has <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> coins and a sufficiently large amount of notes (you can assume that he has an infinite amount of them). Arseny loves modern technologies, so he uses his credit card everywhere except the canteen, but he has to pay in cash in the canteen because it does not accept cards.</p><p>Cashier always asks the student to pay change-free. However, it's not always possible, but Arseny tries to minimize the <span class="tex-font-style-it">dissatisfaction</span> of the cashier. Cashier's dissatisfaction for each of the days is determined by the total amount of notes and coins in the change. To be precise, if the cashier gives Arseny <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> notes and coins on the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th day, his dissatisfaction for this day equals <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i>·<i>w</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span>. Cashier always gives change using as little coins and notes as possible, he always has enough of them to be able to do this.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="378px" src="file://VXqGCHXR.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="378px">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">"Caution!

Help him to find out how he needs to pay in each of the <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> days!</p><p>Note that Arseny always has enough money to pay, because he has an infinite amount of notes.
