## Description

<div><p>The Human-Cow Confederation (<span class="tex-span"><i>HC</i><sup class="upper-index">2</sup></span>), led by Heidi, has built a base where people and cows can hide, guarded from zombie attacks. The entrance to the base is protected by an automated gate which performs a kind of a Turing test: it shows the entering creature a photograph and asks them whether the top and bottom halves of this photograph have been swapped or not. A person (or even a cow) will have no problem answering such questions; on the other hand, a zombie would just randomly smash one of the two buttons.</p><p>The creature is asked a series of such questions. If at least <span class="tex-span">75%</span> of them are answered correctly, the gate is unlocked; otherwise, a side door opens, beneath which a huge fan is spinning...</p><p>Heidi is now building a robot army to fight the zombies, and she wants the robots to also be able to enter the base. You are tasked with programming them to distinguish the images.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ldTaSx4G.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"><p><span class="tex-font-size-small">The first two images from the test set.

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains the number <span class="tex-span"><i>q</i></span> of questions (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>q</i> ≤ 220</span>). After that, <span class="tex-span"><i>q</i></span> questions follow, each of which in the format described below.</p><p>The first line of every question contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>h</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>w</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>h</i>, <i>w</i> ≤ 600</span>) – the height (number of rows) and width (number of columns) of the photograph. (Most photographs are roughly <span class="tex-span">200 × 300</span>.) After this, <span class="tex-span"><i>h</i></span> lines follow, each describing a single row of the picture. The picture is monochrome (in shades of grey). Its <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th row is described by <span class="tex-span"><i>w</i></span> space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>ij</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span"><i>j</i> = 1, ..., <i>w</i></span>), where <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>ij</i></sub></span> is the brightness of the corresponding pixel (<span class="tex-span">0 ≤ <i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>ij</i></sub> &lt; 256</span>, where <span class="tex-span">0</span> is black and <span class="tex-span">255</span> is white).</p><p>Each picture will be either a real-life photograph, or a real-life photograph which has been broken up into two pieces and rearranged. More precisely, in the latter case, the topmost <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://vvrmUOmL.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> rows have been moved to the bottom of the picture. It is guaranteed that <span class="tex-span"><i>h</i></span> is even.</p><p>There is only a single input file to be processed, called <span class="tex-font-style-tt">all.in</span>, and it is downloadable from the online judge. You are also a given another input file, called <span class="tex-font-style-tt">sample.in</span>, which contains the first <span class="tex-span">20</span> pictures from <span class="tex-font-style-tt">all.in</span>; you are provided the correct answers for <span class="tex-font-style-tt">sample.in</span> in <span class="tex-font-style-tt">sample.out</span>.

## Output

<p>Your program should print <span class="tex-span"><i>q</i></span> lines. The <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th line should contain your answer for the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th question: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span> if the photograph has been rearranged and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span> otherwise. Your answers will be accepted if they all conform to this format and if at least <span class="tex-span">75%</span> of them are correct.</p><p>Because the input is rather huge, feel free to process it locally and submit just your precomputed answers (i.e., a program which just prints your output for the input file <span class="tex-font-style-tt">all.in</span>).</p>
