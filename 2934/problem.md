## Description

<div><p>Since Boboniu finished building his Jianghu, he has been doing Kungfu on these mountains every day. </p><p>Boboniu designs a map for his $n$ mountains. He uses $n-1$ roads to connect all $n$ mountains. Every pair of mountains is connected via roads.</p><p>For the $i$-th mountain, Boboniu estimated the tiredness of doing Kungfu on the top of it as $t_i$. He also estimated the height of each mountain as $h_i$.</p><p>A <span class="tex-font-style-it">path</span> is a sequence of mountains $M$ such that for each $i$ ($1 \le i &lt; |M|$), there exists a road between $M_i$ and $M_{i+1}$. Boboniu would regard the <span class="tex-font-style-it">path</span> as a <span class="tex-font-style-it">challenge</span> if for each $i$ ($1\le i&lt;|M|$), $h_{M_i}\le h_{M_{i+1}}$.</p><p>Boboniu wants to divide <span class="tex-font-style-bf">all</span> $n-1$ roads into several <span class="tex-font-style-it">challenges</span>. Note that each road must appear in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly one</span> challenge, but a mountain may appear in several challenges. </p><p>Boboniu wants to minimize the total tiredness to do all the <span class="tex-font-style-it">challenges</span>. The tiredness of a <span class="tex-font-style-it">challenge</span> $M$ is the sum of tiredness of all mountains in it, i.e. $\sum_{i=1}^{|M|}t_{M_i}$. </p><p>He asked you to find the minimum total tiredness. As a reward for your work, you'll become a guardian in his Jianghu.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), denoting the number of the mountains.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^6$), denoting the tiredness for Boboniu to do Kungfu on each mountain.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$ ($1 \le h_i \le 10^6$), denoting the height of each mountain.</p><p>Each of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \neq v_i$), denoting the ends of the road.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), denoting the number of the mountains.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_n$ ($1 \le t_i \le 10^6$), denoting the tiredness for Boboniu to do Kungfu on each mountain.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $h_1, h_2, \ldots, h_n$ ($1 \le h_i \le 10^6$), denoting the height of each mountain.</p><p>Each of the following $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n, u_i \neq v_i$), denoting the ends of the road. It's guaranteed that all mountains are connected via roads.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer: the smallest sum of tiredness of all challenges.</p>

## Note

<p>For the first example:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ifnDeolB.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the picture, the lighter a point is, the higher the mountain it represents. One of the best divisions is:</p><ul> <li> Challenge $1$: $3 \to 1 \to 2$ </li><li> Challenge $2$: $5 \to 2 \to 4$ </li></ul><p>The total tiredness of Boboniu is $(30 + 40 + 10) + (20 + 10 + 50) = 160$. It can be shown that this is the minimum total tiredness.</p>
