## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is an interactive problem.</span></p><p>To prevent the mischievous rabbits from freely roaming around the zoo, Zookeeper has set up a special lock for the rabbit enclosure. This lock is called the Rotary Laser Lock. </p><p> The lock consists of $n$ concentric rings numbered from $0$ to $n-1$. The innermost ring is ring $0$ and the outermost ring is ring $n-1$. All rings are split equally into $nm$ sections each. Each of those rings contains a single metal arc that covers exactly $m$ contiguous sections. At the center of the ring is a core and surrounding the entire lock are $nm$ receivers aligned to the $nm$ sections.</p><p> The core has $nm$ lasers that shine outward from the center, one for each section. The lasers can be blocked by any of the arcs. A display on the outside of the lock shows how many lasers hit the outer receivers.</p><p> </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://jNDeEyFU.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the example above, there are $n=3$ rings, each covering $m=4$ sections. The arcs are colored in green (ring $0$), purple (ring $1$), and blue (ring $2$) while the lasers beams are shown in red. There are $nm=12$ sections and $3$ of the lasers are not blocked by any arc, thus the display will show $3$ in this case.</p><p> Wabbit is trying to open the lock to free the rabbits, but the lock is completely opaque, and he cannot see where any of the arcs are. Given the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">relative positions</span> of the arcs, Wabbit can open the lock on his own. </p><p> To be precise, Wabbit needs $n-1$ integers $p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_{n-1}$ satisfying $0 \leq p_i &lt; nm$ such that for each $i$ $(1 \leq i &lt; n)$, Wabbit can rotate ring $0$ clockwise exactly $p_i$ times such that the sections that ring $0$ covers perfectly aligns with the sections that ring $i$ covers. In the example above, the relative positions are $p_1 = 1$ and $p_2 = 7$.</p><p> To operate the lock, he can pick any of the $n$ rings and rotate them by $1$ section either clockwise or anti-clockwise. You will see the number on the display after every rotation.</p><p>Because his paws are small, Wabbit has asked you to help him to find the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">relative positions</span> of the arcs <span class="tex-font-style-bf">after all of your rotations are completed</span>. You may perform up to $15000$ rotations before Wabbit gets impatient.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line consists of 2 integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \leq n \leq 100, 2 \leq m \leq 20)$, indicating the number of rings and the number of sections each ring covers.</p></div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>To perform a rotation, print on a single line "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">? x d</span>" where $x$ $(0 \leq x &lt; n)$ is the ring that you wish to rotate and $d$ $(d \in \{-1,1\})$ is the direction that you would like to rotate in. $d=1$ indicates a clockwise rotation by $1$ section while $d=-1$ indicates an anticlockwise rotation by $1$ section.</p><p> For each query, you will receive a single integer $a$: the number of lasers that are not blocked by any of the arcs after the rotation has been performed.</p><p>Once you have figured out the relative positions of the arcs, print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">!</span> followed by $n-1$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_{n-1}$. </p><p> Do note that the positions of the rings are predetermined for each test case and won't change during the interaction process.</p><p> After printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output.

## Input

<p>The first line consists of 2 integers $n$ and $m$ $(2 \leq n \leq 100, 2 \leq m \leq 20)$, indicating the number of rings and the number of sections each ring covers.</p>

## Note

<p>For the first test, the configuration is the same as shown on the picture from the statement.</p><p> After the first rotation (which is rotating ring $0$ clockwise by $1$ section), we obtain the following configuration:</p><p> </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://EVd47aVY.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>After the second rotation (which is rotating ring $2$ counter-clockwise by $1$ section), we obtain the following configuration:</p><p> </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://TeCKgmbn.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>After the third rotation (which is rotating ring $1$ clockwise by $1$ section), we obtain the following configuration:</p><p> </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://7GJSpOkK.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>If we rotate ring $0$ clockwise once, we can see that the sections ring $0$ covers will be the same as the sections that ring $1$ covers, hence $p_1=1$.</p><p>If we rotate ring $0$ clockwise five times, the sections ring $0$ covers will be the same as the sections that ring $2$ covers, hence $p_2=5$.</p><p>Note that if we will make a different set of rotations, we can end up with different values of $p_1$ and $p_2$ at the end.</p>
