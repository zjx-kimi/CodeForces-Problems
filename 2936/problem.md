## Input

<p>The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($2\le n\le 2\cdot 10^5$, $2\le m\le \min(2\cdot 10^5,n(n-1) )$, $1\le k\le 9$).</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $u$, $v$ and $w$ $(1\le u,v\le n,u\ne v,1\le w\le m)$, denoting an edge from $u$ to $v$ with weight $w$. It is guaranteed that there are no self-loops or multiple edges and each vertex has at least one edge starting from itself.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the out-degree of each vertex is at most $k$ and no two edges have equal weight.</p>

## Note

<p>For the first example, there are two tuples: $(1,1,3)$ and $(1,2,3)$. The blue edges in the picture denote the $c_i$-th smallest edges for each vertex, which Boboniu chooses to go through.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://BiXz2EBX.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>For the third example, there's only one tuple: $(1,2,2,2)$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://VaGkmY0v.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>The <span class="tex-font-style-it">out-degree</span> of vertex $u$ means the number of edges outgoing from $u$.</p>
