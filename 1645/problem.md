## Description

<div><p>Vitaly enrolled in the course Advanced Useless Algorithms. The course consists of $n$ tasks. Vitaly calculated that he has $a_i$ hours to do the task $i$ from the day he enrolled in the course. That is, the deadline before the $i$-th task is $a_i$ hours. The array $a$ is sorted in ascending order, in other words, the job numbers correspond to the order in which the assignments are turned in.</p><p>Vitaly does everything conscientiously, so he wants to complete <span class="tex-font-style-bf">each</span> task by $100$ percent, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">or more</span>. Initially, his completion rate for each task is $0$ percent.</p><p>Vitaly has $m$ training options, each option can be used <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not more than</span> once. The $i$th option is characterized by three integers: $e_i, t_i$ and $p_i$. If Vitaly uses the $i$th option, then after $t_i$ hours (from the current moment) he will increase the progress of the task $e_i$ by $p_i$ percent. </p><p>For example, let Vitaly have $3$ of tasks to complete. Let the array $a$ have the form: $a = [5, 7, 8]$. Suppose Vitaly has $5$ of options: $[e_1=1, t_1=1, p_1=30]$, $[e_2=2, t_2=3, p_2=50]$, $[e_3=2, t_3=3, p_3=100]$, $[e_4=1, t_4=1, p_4=80]$, $[e_5=3, t_5=3, p_5=100]$. </p><p>Then, if Vitaly prepares in the following way, he will be able to complete everything in time: </p><ul> <li> Vitaly chooses the $4$-th option. Then in $1$ hour, he will complete the $1$-st task at $80$ percent. He still has $4$ hours left before the deadline for the $1$-st task. </li><li> Vitaly chooses the $3$-rd option. Then in $3$ hours, he will complete the $2$-nd task in its entirety. He has another $1$ hour left before the deadline for the $1$-st task and $4$ hours left before the deadline for the $3$-rd task. </li><li> Vitaly chooses the $1$-st option. Then after $1$ hour, he will complete the $1$-st task for $110$ percent, which means that he will complete the $1$-st task just in time for the deadline. </li><li> Vitaly chooses the $5$-th option. He will complete the $3$-rd task for $2$ hours, and after another $1$ hour, Vitaly will complete the $3$-rd task in its entirety. </li></ul><p>Thus, Vitaly has managed to complete the course completely and on time, using the $4$ options.</p><p>Help Vitaly&nbsp;— print the options for Vitaly to complete the tasks in the correct order. Please note: each option can be used <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not more than</span> once. If there are several possible answers, it is allowed to output any of them.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input data contains an integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 10^4$)&nbsp;—the number of input test cases in the test.</p><p>The descriptions of the input test case follow.</p><p>The first line of each test case description contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n,m \le 10^5$)&nbsp;—the number of jobs and the number of training options, respectively.</p><p>The next line contains $n$ numbers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the time before the deadline of job $i$.

## Output

<p>For each test case, print on the first line the number $k$, meaning that for $k$ of options, Vitaly will be able to complete each task by $100$ percent or more on time. The options should not be repeated. Or print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span> if Vitaly is unable to complete all tasks in time.</p><p>If there is an answer, on the next line print $k$ of different integers from $1$ to $m$&nbsp;— the numbers of the options in the order you want. If there is more than one answer, it is allowed to print <span class="tex-font-style-bf">any</span> of them.</p>
