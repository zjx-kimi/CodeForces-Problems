## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The only difference between the easy and the hard version is the constraint on $n$.</span></p><p>You are given an undirected complete graph on $n$ vertices.

Similarly, a set of vertices $S$ is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">blue-connected</span> if, for every pair of vertices $(v_1, v_2)$ such that $v_1 \in S$ and $v_2 \in S$, there exists a path from $v_1$ to $v_2$ that goes only through blue edges and vertices from $S$.</p><p>You have to paint the graph in such a way that:</p><ul> <li> there is at least one red edge; </li><li> there is at least one blue edge; </li><li> for each set of vertices $S$ such that $|S| \ge 2$, $S$ is either red-connected or blue-connected, but <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not both</span>. </li></ul><p>Calculate the number of ways to paint the graph, and print it modulo $998244353$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first (and only) line contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer — the number of ways to paint the graph, taken modulo $998244353$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first (and only) line contains one integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^4$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer — the number of ways to paint the graph, taken modulo $998244353$.</p>
