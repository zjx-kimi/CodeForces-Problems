## Description

<div><p>You are given a tree consisting exactly of $n$ vertices. Tree is a connected undirected graph with $n-1$ edges. Each vertex $v$ of this tree has a value $a_v$ assigned to it.</p><p>Let $dist(x, y)$ be the distance between the vertices $x$ and $y$. The distance between the vertices is the number of edges on the simple path between them.</p><p>Let's define the cost of the tree as the following value: firstly, let's fix some vertex of the tree. Let it be $v$. Then the cost of the tree is $\sum\limits_{i = 1}^{n} dist(i, v) \cdot a_i$.</p><p>Your task is to calculate the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximum possible cost</span> of the tree if you can choose $v$ arbitrarily.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $n$, the number of vertices in the tree ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the value of the vertex $i$.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer — the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximum possible cost</span> of the tree if you can choose any vertex as $v$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$, the number of vertices in the tree ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$), where $a_i$ is the value of the vertex $i$.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines describes an edge of the tree. Edge $i$ is denoted by two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$, the labels of vertices it connects ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer — the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">maximum possible cost</span> of the tree if you can choose any vertex as $v$.</p>

## Note

<p>Picture corresponding to the first example: <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://c5PGx9RQ.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>You can choose the vertex $3$ as a root, then the answer will be $2 \cdot 9 + 1 \cdot 4 + 0 \cdot 1 + 3 \cdot 7 + 3 \cdot 10 + 4 \cdot 1 + 4 \cdot 6 + 4 \cdot 5 = 18 + 4 + 0 + 21 + 30 + 4 + 24 + 20 = 121$.</p><p>In the second example tree consists only of one vertex so the answer is always $0$.</p>
