## Description

<div><p>On the number line there are $m$ points, $i$-th of which has integer coordinate $x_i$ and integer weight $w_i$. The coordinates of all points are different, and the points are numbered from $1$ to $m$.</p><p>A sequence of $n$ segments $[l_1, r_1], [l_2, r_2], \dots, [l_n, r_n]$ is called <span class="tex-font-style-it">system of nested segments</span> if for each pair $i, j$ ($1 \le i &lt; j \le n$) the condition $l_i &lt; l_j &lt; r_j &lt; r_i$ is satisfied. In other words, the second segment is strictly inside the first one, the third segment is strictly inside the second one, and so on.</p><p>For a given number $n$, find a system of nested segments such that:</p><ul> <li> both ends of each segment are one of $m$ given points; </li><li> the sum of the weights $2\cdot n$ of the points used as ends of the segments is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">minimal</span>. </li></ul><p>For example, let $m = 8$. The given points are marked in the picture, their weights are marked in red, their coordinates are marked in blue. Make a system of three nested segments:</p><ul> <li> weight of the first segment: $1 + 1 = 2$ </li><li> weight of the second segment: $10 + (-1) = 9$ </li><li> weight of the third segment: $3 + (-2) = 1$ </li><li> sum of the weights of all the segments in the system: $2 + 9 + 1 = 12$ </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://k6kmdG2u.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">System of three nested segments</span> </center></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input data contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;—the number of input test cases.</p><p>An empty line is written before each test case.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) and $m$ ($2 \cdot n \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). </p><p>The next $m$ lines contain pairs of integers $x_i$ ($-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9$) and $w_i$ ($-10^4 \le w_i \le 10^4$) — coordinate and weight of point number $i$ ($1 \le i \le m$) respectively.

## Input

<p>The first line of input data contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;—the number of input test cases.</p><p>An empty line is written before each test case.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two positive integers $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$) and $m$ ($2 \cdot n \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$). </p><p>The next $m$ lines contain pairs of integers $x_i$ ($-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9$) and $w_i$ ($-10^4 \le w_i \le 10^4$) — coordinate and weight of point number $i$ ($1 \le i \le m$) respectively. All $x_i$ are different.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $m$ values over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output $n + 1$ lines: in the first of them, output the weight of the composed system, and in the next $n$ lines output exactly two numbers &nbsp;— the indices of the points which are the endpoints of the $i$-th segment ($1 \le i \le n$). The order in which you output the endpoints of a segment is not important — you can output the index of the left endpoint first and then the number of the right endpoint, or the other way around.</p><p>If there are several ways to make a system of nested segments with minimal weight, output any of them.</p>

## Note

<p>The first test case coincides with the example from the condition. It can be shown that the weight of the composed system is minimal.</p><p>The second test case has only $6$ points, so you need to use each of them to compose $3$ segments.</p>
