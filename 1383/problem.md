## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The description of each test case consists of four <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ ($0 \leq a, b, c, d \leq 10^4$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the number of participants in front of Timur.</p>

## Note

<p>For the first test case, there are $2$ people in front of Timur, specifically the participants who ran distances of $3$ and $4$. The other participant is not in front of Timur because he ran a shorter distance than Timur.</p><p>For the second test case, no one is in front of Timur, since he ran a distance of $10000$ while all others ran a distance of $0$, $1$, and $2$ respectively.</p><p>For the third test case, only the second person is in front of Timur, who ran a total distance of $600$ while Timur ran a distance of $500$.</p>
