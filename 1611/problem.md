## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>In the first line of each test case contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($\color{red}{\boldsymbol{0} \boldsymbol{\le} \boldsymbol{l}} \le r &lt; 2^{17}$).</p><p>The second line contains $r - l + 1$ space-seperated integers of $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_{r-l+1}$ ($0 \le a_i &lt; 2^{17}$). It is guaranteed that array $a$ is valid.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $r - l + 1$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{17}$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case print an integer $x$. If there are multiple answers, print any.</p>
