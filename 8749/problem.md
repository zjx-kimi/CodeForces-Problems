## Description

<div><p>Chilly Willy loves playing with numbers. He only knows prime numbers that are digits yet. These numbers are <span class="tex-span">2</span>, <span class="tex-span">3</span>, <span class="tex-span">5</span> and <span class="tex-span">7</span>. But Willy grew rather bored of such numbers, so he came up with a few games that were connected with them.</p><p>Chilly Willy wants to find the minimum number of length <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>, such that it is simultaneously divisible by all numbers Willy already knows (<span class="tex-span">2</span>, <span class="tex-span">3</span>, <span class="tex-span">5</span> and <span class="tex-span">7</span>). Help him with that.</p><p>A number's length is the number of digits in its decimal representation without leading zeros.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>A single input line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem without leading zeroes, or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>" (without the quotes), if the number that meet the problem condition does not exist.</p></div>

## Input

<p>A single input line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>).</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer — the answer to the problem without leading zeroes, or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>" (without the quotes), if the number that meet the problem condition does not exist.</p>
