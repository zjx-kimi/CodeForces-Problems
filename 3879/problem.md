## Description

<div><p>Gildong is experimenting with an interesting machine <span class="tex-font-style-it">Graph Traveler</span>. In Graph Traveler, there is a directed graph consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. The $i$-th vertex has $m_i$ outgoing edges that are labeled as $e_i[0]$, $e_i[1]$, $\ldots$, $e_i[m_i-1]$, each representing the destination vertex of the edge. The graph can have multiple edges and self-loops. The $i$-th vertex also has an integer $k_i$ written on itself.</p><p>A <span class="tex-font-style-it">travel</span> on this graph works as follows. </p><ol> <li> Gildong chooses a vertex to start from, and an integer to start with. Set the variable $c$ to this integer. </li><li> After arriving at the vertex $i$, or when Gildong begins the travel at some vertex $i$, add $k_i$ to $c$. </li><li> The next vertex is $e_i[x]$ where $x$ is an integer $0 \le x \le m_i-1$ satisfying $x \equiv c \pmod {m_i}$. Go to the next vertex and go back to step 2. </li></ol><p>It's obvious that a travel never ends, since the 2nd and the 3rd step will be repeated endlessly.</p><p>For example, assume that Gildong starts at vertex $1$ with $c = 5$, and $m_1 = 2$, $e_1[0] = 1$, $e_1[1] = 2$, $k_1 = -3$. Right after he starts at vertex $1$, $c$ becomes $2$. Since the only integer $x$ ($0 \le x \le 1$) where $x \equiv c \pmod {m_i}$ is $0$, Gildong goes to vertex $e_1[0] = 1$. After arriving at vertex $1$ again, $c$ becomes $-1$. The only integer $x$ satisfying the conditions is $1$, so he goes to vertex $e_1[1] = 2$, and so on.</p><p>Since Gildong is quite inquisitive, he's going to ask you $q$ queries. He wants to know how many <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> vertices will be visited <span class="tex-font-style-bf">infinitely many times</span>, if he starts the travel from a certain vertex with a certain value of $c$. Note that you should <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not</span> count the vertices that will be visited only finite times.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of vertices in the graph.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers. The $i$-th integer is $k_i$ ($-10^9 \le k_i \le 10^9$), the integer written on the $i$-th vertex.</p><p>Next $2 \cdot n$ lines describe the edges of each vertex. The $(2 \cdot i + 1)$-st line contains an integer $m_i$ ($1 \le m_i \le 10$), the number of outgoing edges of the $i$-th vertex. The $(2 \cdot i + 2)$-nd line contains $m_i$ integers $e_i[0]$, $e_i[1]$, $\ldots$, $e_i[m_i-1]$, each having an integer value between $1$ and $n$, inclusive.</p><p>Next line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.</p><p>Next $q$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x \le n$, $-10^9 \le y \le 10^9$) each, which mean that the start vertex is $x$ and the starting value of $c$ is $y$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query, print the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> vertices that will be visited <span class="tex-font-style-bf">infinitely many times</span>, if Gildong starts at vertex $x$ with starting integer $y$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$), the number of vertices in the graph.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers. The $i$-th integer is $k_i$ ($-10^9 \le k_i \le 10^9$), the integer written on the $i$-th vertex.</p><p>Next $2 \cdot n$ lines describe the edges of each vertex. The $(2 \cdot i + 1)$-st line contains an integer $m_i$ ($1 \le m_i \le 10$), the number of outgoing edges of the $i$-th vertex. The $(2 \cdot i + 2)$-nd line contains $m_i$ integers $e_i[0]$, $e_i[1]$, $\ldots$, $e_i[m_i-1]$, each having an integer value between $1$ and $n$, inclusive.</p><p>Next line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.</p><p>Next $q$ lines contains two integers $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x \le n$, $-10^9 \le y \le 10^9$) each, which mean that the start vertex is $x$ and the starting value of $c$ is $y$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each query, print the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> vertices that will be visited <span class="tex-font-style-bf">infinitely many times</span>, if Gildong starts at vertex $x$ with starting integer $y$.</p>

## Note

<p>The first example can be shown like the following image:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://oXbdqwBn.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Three integers are marked on $i$-th vertex: $i$, $k_i$, and $m_i$ respectively. The outgoing edges are labeled with an integer representing the edge number of $i$-th vertex.</p><p>The travel for each query works as follows. It is described as a sequence of phrases, each in the format "vertex ($c$ after $k_i$ added)".</p><ul> <li> $1(0) \to 2(0) \to 2(0) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $2(0) \to 2(0) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $3(-1) \to 1(-1) \to 3(-1) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $4(-2) \to 2(-2) \to 2(-2) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $1(1) \to 3(1) \to 4(1) \to 1(1) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $1(5) \to 3(5) \to 1(5) \to \ldots$ </li></ul><p>The second example is same as the first example, except that the vertices have non-zero values. Therefore the answers to the queries also differ from the first example.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://EcJQNRnB.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>The queries for the second example works as follows:</p><ul> <li> $1(4) \to 2(-1) \to 2(-6) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $2(-5) \to 2(-10) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $3(-4) \to 1(0) \to 2(-5) \to 2(-10) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $4(-3) \to 1(1) \to 3(-2) \to 4(-3) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $1(5) \to 3(2) \to 1(6) \to 2(1) \to 2(-4) \to \ldots$ </li><li> $1(9) \to 3(6) \to 2(1) \to 2(-4) \to \ldots$ </li></ul>
