## Input

<p>The first line contains a two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 10^5$), the size of arrays $a$ and $b$ and the number of segments.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(0 \le a_i \le 10^9)$.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ $(0 \le b_i \le 10^9)$.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $l_i$ and $r_i$ $(1 \le l_i &lt; r_i \le n)$, the edges of segments.</p>

## Output

<p>For each segment output a single number&nbsp;— the minimal number of balancing operations needed or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>" if it is impossible to equalize segments of arrays.</p>

## Note

<p>For the first segment from $2$ to $6$ you can do one operation with $pos = [2, 3, 5, 6]$, after this operation the arrays will be: $a = [0, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5]$, $b = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 5, 8]$. Arrays are equal on a segment from $2$ to $6$ after this operation.</p><p>For the second segment from $1$ to $7$ you can do three following operations: </p><ol> <li> $pos = [1, 3, 5, 6]$ </li><li> $pos = [1, 7]$ </li><li> $pos = [2, 7]$ </li></ol><p>After these operations, the arrays will be: $a = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 5]$, $b = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 2, 7, 8]$. Arrays are equal on a segment from $1$ to $7$ after these operations.</p><p>For the third segment from $2$ to $4$ you can do one operation with $pos = [2, 3]$, after the operation arrays will be: $a = [0, 2, 2, 9, 3, 2, 7, 5]$, $b = [2, 2, 2, 9, 4, 1, 5, 8]$. Arrays are equal on a segment from $2$ to $4$ after this operation.</p><p>It is impossible to equalize the fourth and the fifth segment.</p>
