## Description

<div><p>Gildong was hiking a mountain, walking by millions of trees. Inspired by them, he suddenly came up with an interesting idea for trees in data structures: <span class="tex-font-style-it">What if we add another edge in a tree?</span></p><p>Then he found that such tree-like graphs are called <span class="tex-font-style-it">1-trees</span>. Since Gildong was bored of solving too many tree problems, he wanted to see if similar techniques in trees can be used in 1-trees as well. Instead of solving it by himself, he's going to test you by providing queries on 1-trees.</p><p>First, he'll provide you a tree (not 1-tree) with $n$ vertices, then he will ask you $q$ queries. Each query contains $5$ integers: $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$. This means you're asked to determine if there exists a path from vertex $a$ to $b$ that contains exactly $k$ edges after adding a bidirectional edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">A path can contain the same vertices and same edges multiple times</span>. All queries are independent of each other; i.e. the added edge in a query is removed in the next query.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 10^5$), the number of vertices of the tree.</p><p>Next $n-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$, $u \ne v$) each, which means there is an edge between vertex $u$ and $v$. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.</p><p>Next line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.</p><p>Next $q$ lines contain five integers $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$ each ($1 \le x,y,a,b \le n$, $x \ne y$, $1 \le k \le 10^9$) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between $x$ and $y$ does not exist in the original tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if there exists a path that contains exactly $k$ edges from vertex $a$ to $b$ after adding an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 10^5$), the number of vertices of the tree.</p><p>Next $n-1$ lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$, $u \ne v$) each, which means there is an edge between vertex $u$ and $v$. All edges are bidirectional and distinct.</p><p>Next line contains an integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 10^5$), the number of queries Gildong wants to ask.</p><p>Next $q$ lines contain five integers $x$, $y$, $a$, $b$, and $k$ each ($1 \le x,y,a,b \le n$, $x \ne y$, $1 \le k \le 10^9$) – the integers explained in the description. It is guaranteed that the edge between $x$ and $y$ does not exist in the original tree.</p>

## Output

<p>For each query, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if there exists a path that contains exactly $k$ edges from vertex $a$ to $b$ after adding an edge between vertices $x$ and $y$. Otherwise, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p><p>You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</p>
