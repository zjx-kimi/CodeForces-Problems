## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($3 \le n \le 10^{5}$, $0 \le m \le \text{min}(3 \cdot 10^{5}, \frac{n(n-1)}{2})$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices and edges in the graph.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \le a_{i} \lt b_{i} \le n$)&nbsp;— it means there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. The graph doesn't contain self-loops, there is at most one edge between a pair of vertices. The given graph can be disconnected.</p>

## Output

<p>If the answer exists, print $n$ integers. $i$-th integer means the vertex set number (from $1$ to $3$) of $i$-th vertex. Otherwise, print $-1$.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, if $v_{1} = \{ 1 \}$, $v_{2} = \{ 2, 3 \}$, and $v_{3} = \{ 4, 5, 6 \}$ then vertex sets will satisfy all conditions. But you can assign vertices to vertex sets in a different way; Other answers like "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">2 3 3 1 1 1</span>" will be accepted as well.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://bFSRit56.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second example, it's impossible to make such vertex sets.</p>
