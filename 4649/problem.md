## Description

<div><p>Doremy is asked to test $n$ contests. Contest $i$ can only be tested on day $i$. The difficulty of contest $i$ is $a_i$. Initially, Doremy's IQ is $q$. On day $i$ Doremy will choose whether to test contest $i$ or not. She can only test a contest if her current IQ is strictly greater than $0$.</p><p>If Doremy chooses to test contest $i$ on day $i$, the following happens: </p><ul> <li> if $a_i&gt;q$, Doremy will feel she is not wise enough, so $q$ decreases by $1$; </li><li> otherwise, nothing changes. </li></ul> If she chooses not to test a contest, nothing changes.<p>Doremy wants to test as many contests as possible. Please give Doremy a solution.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of contests and Doremy's IQ in the beginning.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the difficulty of each contest.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, you need to output a binary string $s$, where $s_i=1$ if Doremy should choose to test contest $i$, and $s_i=0$ otherwise.

## Input

<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of contests and Doremy's IQ in the beginning.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\cdots,a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the difficulty of each contest.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, you need to output a binary string $s$, where $s_i=1$ if Doremy should choose to test contest $i$, and $s_i=0$ otherwise. The number of ones in the string should be maximum possible, and she should never test a contest when her IQ is zero or less.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, Doremy tests the only contest. Her IQ doesn't decrease.</p><p>In the second test case, Doremy tests both contests. Her IQ decreases by $1$ after testing contest $2$.</p><p>In the third test case, Doremy tests contest $1$ and $2$. Her IQ decreases to $0$ after testing contest $2$, so she can't test contest $3$.</p>
