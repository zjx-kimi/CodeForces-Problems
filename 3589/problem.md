## Description

<div><p>You're given a simple, undirected, connected, weighted graph with $n$ nodes and $m$ edges.</p><p>Nodes are numbered from $1$ to $n$. There are exactly $k$ <span class="tex-font-style-it">centrals</span> (recharge points), which are nodes $1, 2, \ldots, k$.</p><p>We consider a robot moving into this graph, with a battery of capacity $c$, not fixed by the constructor yet. At any time, the battery contains an integer amount $x$ of energy between $0$ and $c$ inclusive.</p><p>Traversing an edge of weight $w_i$ is possible only if $x \ge w_i$, and costs $w_i$ energy points ($x := x - w_i$).</p><p>Moreover, when the robot reaches a central, its battery is entirely recharged ($x := c$).</p><p>You're given $q$ <span class="tex-font-style-underline">independent</span> missions, the $i$-th mission requires to move the robot from <span class="tex-font-style-underline">central</span> $a_i$ to <span class="tex-font-style-underline">central</span> $b_i$.</p><p>For each mission, you should tell the minimum capacity required to acheive it.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains four integers $n$, $m$, $k$ and $q$ ($2 \le k \le n \le 10^5$ and $1 \le m, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $w_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \neq v_i$, $1 \le w_i \le 10^9$), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$, with a weight $w_i$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes) and connected.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le k$, $a_i \neq b_i$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>You have to output $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains a single integer : the minimum capacity required to acheive the $i$-th mission.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains four integers $n$, $m$, $k$ and $q$ ($2 \le k \le n \le 10^5$ and $1 \le m, q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$).</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $w_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \neq v_i$, $1 \le w_i \le 10^9$), that mean that there's an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$, with a weight $w_i$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given graph is simple (there is no self-loop, and there is at most one edge between every pair of nodes) and connected.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $a_i$ and $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le k$, $a_i \neq b_i$).</p>

## Output

<p>You have to output $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains a single integer : the minimum capacity required to acheive the $i$-th mission.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, the graph is the chain $10 - 9 - 2^C - 4 - 1^C - 5 - 7 - 3^C - 8 - 6$, where centrals are nodes $1$, $2$ and $3$.</p><p>For the mission $(2, 3)$, there is only one simple path possible. Here is a simulation of this mission when the capacity is $12$.</p><ul> <li> The robot begins on the node $2$, with $c = 12$ energy points. </li><li> The robot uses an edge of weight $4$.</li><li> The robot reaches the node $4$, with $12 - 4 = 8$ energy points. </li><li> The robot uses an edge of weight $8$.</li><li> The robot reaches the node $1$ with $8 - 8 = 0$ energy points. </li><li> The robot is on a central, so its battery is recharged. He has now $c = 12$ energy points. </li><li> The robot uses an edge of weight $2$.</li><li> The robot is on the node $5$, with $12 - 2 = 10$ energy points. </li><li> The robot uses an edge of weight $3$.</li><li> The robot is on the node $7$, with $10 - 3 = 7$ energy points. </li><li> The robot uses an edge of weight $2$.</li><li> The robot is on the node $3$, with $7 - 2 = 5$ energy points. </li><li> The robot is on a central, so its battery is recharged. He has now $c = 12$ energy points. </li><li> End of the simulation. </li></ul><p>Note that if value of $c$ was lower than $12$, we would have less than $8$ energy points on node $4$, and we would be unable to use the edge $4 \leftrightarrow 1$ of weight $8$. Hence $12$ is the minimum capacity required to acheive the mission.</p><p>—</p><p>The graph of the second example is described here (centrals are red nodes):</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://Ocyv8jul.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>The robot can acheive the mission $(3, 1)$ with a battery of capacity $c = 38$, using the path $3 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 6 \rightarrow 5 \rightarrow 4 \rightarrow 1$</p><p>The robot can acheive the mission $(2, 3)$ with a battery of capacity $c = 15$, using the path $2 \rightarrow 7 \rightarrow 8 \rightarrow 9 \rightarrow 3$</p>
