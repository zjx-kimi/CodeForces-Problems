## Description

<div><p>Your security guard friend recently got a new job at a new security company. The company requires him to patrol an area of the city encompassing exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> city blocks, but they let him choose which blocks. That is, your friend must walk the perimeter of a region whose area is exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> blocks. Your friend is quite lazy and would like your help to find the shortest possible route that meets the requirements. The city is laid out in a square grid pattern, and is large enough that for the sake of the problem it can be considered infinite.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Input will consist of a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">6</sup></span>), the number of city blocks that must be enclosed by the route.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the minimum perimeter that can be achieved.</p></div>
