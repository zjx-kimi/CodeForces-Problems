Two people can use the same desk: one sitting on the left and one sitting on the right. </p><p>Some places are already occupied, and some places are vacant. Petya has just entered the class and wants to occupy the most convenient place.

## Input

<p>The input consists of <span class="tex-span">6</span> lines. Each line describes one row of desks, starting from the closest to the blackboard. Each line is given in the following format: two characters, each is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">*</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>' — the description of the left desk in the current row; a character '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-</span>' — the aisle; two characters, each is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">*</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>' — the description of the center desk in the current row; a character '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-</span>' — the aisle; two characters, each is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">*</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>' — the description of the right desk in the current row.
