## Description

<div><p>Ashish has a tree consisting of $n$ nodes numbered $1$ to $n$ rooted at node $1$. The $i$-th node in the tree has a cost $a_i$, and binary digit $b_i$ is written in it. He wants to have binary digit $c_i$ written in the $i$-th node in the end.</p><p>To achieve this, he can perform the following operation any number of times: </p><ul> <li> Select any $k$ nodes from the subtree of any node $u$, and shuffle the digits in these nodes as he wishes, incurring a cost of $k \cdot a_u$. Here, he can choose $k$ ranging from $1$ to the size of the subtree of $u$. </li></ul><p>He wants to perform the operations in such a way that every node finally has the digit corresponding to its target.</p><p>Help him find the minimum total cost he needs to spend so that after all the operations, every node $u$ has digit $c_u$ written in it, or determine that it is impossible.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>First line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ denoting the number of nodes in the tree.</p><p>$i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains 3 space-separated integers $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9, 0 \leq b_i, c_i \leq 1)$ &nbsp;— the cost of the $i$-th node, its initial digit and its goal digit.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contain two integers $u$, $v$ $(1 \leq u, v \leq n, \text{ } u \ne v)$, meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$ in the tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the minimum total cost to make every node reach its target digit, and $-1$ if it is impossible.</p></div>

## Input

<p>First line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ denoting the number of nodes in the tree.</p><p>$i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contains 3 space-separated integers $a_i$, $b_i$, $c_i$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9, 0 \leq b_i, c_i \leq 1)$ &nbsp;— the cost of the $i$-th node, its initial digit and its goal digit.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contain two integers $u$, $v$ $(1 \leq u, v \leq n, \text{ } u \ne v)$, meaning that there is an edge between nodes $u$ and $v$ in the tree.</p>

## Output

<p>Print the minimum total cost to make every node reach its target digit, and $-1$ if it is impossible.</p>

## Note

<p>The tree corresponding to samples $1$ and $2$ are: </p><center><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://GZINz88a.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></center><p>In sample $1$, we can choose node $1$ and $k = 4$ for a cost of $4 \cdot 1$ = $4$ and select nodes ${1, 2, 3, 5}$, shuffle their digits and get the desired digits in every node.</p><p>In sample $2$, we can choose node $1$ and $k = 2$ for a cost of $10000 \cdot 2$, select nodes ${1, 5}$ and exchange their digits, and similarly, choose node $2$ and $k = 2$ for a cost of $2000 \cdot 2$, select nodes ${2, 3}$ and exchange their digits to get the desired digits in every node.</p><p>In sample $3$, it is impossible to get the desired digits, because there is no node with digit $1$ initially.</p>
