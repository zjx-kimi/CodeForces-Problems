## Description

<div><p>There is a graph of $n$ rows and $10^6 + 2$ columns, where rows are numbered from $1$ to $n$ and columns from $0$ to $10^6 + 1$:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://b8RZ55h1.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Let's denote the node in the row $i$ and column $j$ by $(i, j)$.</p><p>Initially for each $i$ the $i$-th row has exactly one obstacle — at node $(i, a_i)$. You want to move some obstacles so that you can reach node $(n, 10^6+1)$ from node $(1, 0)$ by moving through edges of this graph (you can't pass through obstacles). Moving one obstacle to an adjacent by edge free node costs $u$ or $v$ coins, as below:</p><ul> <li> If there is an obstacle in the node $(i, j)$, you can use $u$ coins to move it to $(i-1, j)$ or $(i+1, j)$, if such node exists and if there is no obstacle in that node currently. </li><li> If there is an obstacle in the node $(i, j)$, you can use $v$ coins to move it to $(i, j-1)$ or $(i, j+1)$, if such node exists and if there is no obstacle in that node currently. </li><li> Note that you <span class="tex-font-style-bf">can't move obstacles outside the grid</span>. For example, you can't move an obstacle from $(1,1)$ to $(0,1)$. </li></ul><p>Refer to the picture above for a better understanding. </p><p>Now you need to calculate the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node $(n, 10^6+1)$ from node $(1, 0)$ by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $u$ and $v$ ($2 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le u, v \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of rows in the graph and the numbers of coins needed to move vertically and horizontally respectively.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$)&nbsp;— where $a_i$ represents that the obstacle in the $i$-th row is in node $(i, a_i)$.</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^4$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node $(n, 10^6+1)$ from node $(1, 0)$ by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.</p><p>It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem there is always a way to make such a trip possible.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $u$ and $v$ ($2 \le n \le 100$, $1 \le u, v \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of rows in the graph and the numbers of coins needed to move vertically and horizontally respectively.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^6$)&nbsp;— where $a_i$ represents that the obstacle in the $i$-th row is in node $(i, a_i)$.</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^4$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the minimal number of coins you need to spend to be able to reach node $(n, 10^6+1)$ from node $(1, 0)$ by moving through edges of this graph without passing through obstacles.</p><p>It can be shown that under the constraints of the problem there is always a way to make such a trip possible.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first sample, two obstacles are at $(1, 2)$ and $(2,2)$. You can move the obstacle on $(2, 2)$ to $(2, 3)$, then to $(1, 3)$. The total cost is $u+v = 7$ coins.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://beokjjOu.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second sample, two obstacles are at $(1, 3)$ and $(2,2)$.
