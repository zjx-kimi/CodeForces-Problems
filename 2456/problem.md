## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2\leq n,q \leq 10^5$) — the number of nodes and the number of queries, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $n-1$ integers $a_2, a_3,\dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i &lt; i$), where $a_i$ is the parent of the node $i$.</p><p>Next $q$ lines contain queries. For each query, the first integer of each line is $t$ ($t = 1$ or $2$) — the type of the query. </p><p> If $t = 1$, this represents the query of the first type. Then, three integers will follow: $l$, $r$, $x$ ($2 \le l \le r \le n$, $1 \le x \le 10^5$), meaning that you have to replace $a_i$ with $\max(a_i-x,1)$ for all $i$ with $l \leq i \leq r$.</p><p> If $t = 2$, this represents the query of the second type. Then, two integers will follow: $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$), and you have to find the LCA of $u$ and $v$. </p><p> It's guaranteed that there is at least one query of the second type.</p>

## Output

<p>For each query of the second type output answer on a new line.</p>





```input1

2 5 6
2 2 3
```




```output1
