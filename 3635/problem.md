## Description

<div><p>Gardener Alexey teaches competitive programming to high school students. To congratulate Alexey on the Teacher's Day, the students have gifted him a collection of wooden sticks, where every stick has an integer length. Now Alexey wants to grow a tree from them.</p><p>The tree looks like a polyline on the plane, consisting of all sticks. The polyline starts at the point $(0, 0)$. While constructing the polyline, Alexey will attach sticks to it one by one in arbitrary order. Each stick must be either vertical or horizontal (that is, parallel to $OX$ or $OY$ axis). It is not allowed for two consecutive sticks to be aligned simultaneously horizontally or simultaneously vertically. See the images below for clarification.</p><p>Alexey wants to make a polyline in such a way that its end is as far as possible from $(0, 0)$. Please help him to grow the tree this way.</p><p>Note that the polyline defining the form of the tree may have self-intersections and self-touches, but it can be proved that the optimal answer does not contain any self-intersections or self-touches.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of sticks Alexey got as a present.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10\,000$) — the lengths of the sticks.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer&nbsp;— the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">square</span> of the largest possible distance from $(0, 0)$ to the tree end.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of sticks Alexey got as a present.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10\,000$) — the lengths of the sticks.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer&nbsp;— the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">square</span> of the largest possible distance from $(0, 0)$ to the tree end.</p>





```input1
3
1 2 3
```




```input2
4
1 1 2 2
```




```output1
26
```




```output2
20
```



## Note

<p>The following pictures show optimal trees for example tests. The squared distance in the first example equals $5 \cdot 5 + 1 \cdot 1 = 26$, and in the second example $4 \cdot 4 + 2 \cdot 2 = 20$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="151px" src="file://RwQRflb1.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="302px"> </center><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="151px" src="file://JAZz4fBO.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="302px"> </center>
