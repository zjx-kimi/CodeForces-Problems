## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200$) &nbsp;— the size of the permutation.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$, all $p_i$ are distinct) &nbsp;— the elements of the permutation.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $400$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output $n$ integers $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ ($1 \le q_i \le n$, all $q_i$ are distinct) &nbsp;— one of the permutations with the smallest weight.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, there are two permutations of length $2$: $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 1)$. Permutation $(1, 2)$ has weight $|1 - p_2| + |2 - p_1| = 0$, and permutation $(2, 1)$ has the same weight: $|2 - p_1| + |1 - p_2| = 0$. You can output any of these permutations in this version.</p><p>In the second test case, the weight of the permutation $(1, 3, 4, 2)$ is $|1 - p_3| + |3 - p_4| + |4 - p_2| + |2 - p_1| = |1 - 1| + |3 - 4| + |4 - 3| + |2 - 2| = 2$. There are no permutations with smaller weights.</p><p>In the third test case, the weight of the permutation $(1, 4, 2, 3, 5)$ is $|1 - p_4| + |4 - p_2| + |2 - p_3| + |3 - p_5| + |5 - p_1| = |1 - 2| + |4 - 4| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 1| + |5 - 5| = 4$. There are no permutations with smaller weights.</p>
