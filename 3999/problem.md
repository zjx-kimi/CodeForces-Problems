## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is the second subtask of problem F. The only differences between this and the first subtask are the constraints on the value of $m$ and the time limit. It is sufficient to solve this subtask in order to hack it, but you need to solve both subtasks in order to hack the first one.</span></p><p>There are $n+1$ distinct colours in the universe, numbered $0$ through $n$. There is a strip of paper $m$ centimetres long initially painted with colour $0$. </p><p>Alice took a brush and painted the strip using the following process. For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">in this order</span>, she picks two integers $0 \leq a_i &lt; b_i \leq m$, such that the segment $[a_i, b_i]$ is currently painted with a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">single</span> colour, and repaints it with colour $i$. </p><p>Alice chose the segments in such a way that each centimetre is now painted in some colour other than $0$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 500$, $n \leq m \leq 10^6$)&nbsp;— the number of colours excluding the colour $0$ and the length of the paper, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $m$ space separated integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m$ ($1 \leq c_i \leq n$)&nbsp;— the colour visible on the segment $[i-1, i]$ after the process ends. It is guaranteed that for all $j$ between $1$ and $n$ there is an index $k$ such that $c_k = j$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, there are $5$ ways, all depicted in the figure below. Here, $0$ is white, $1$ is red, $2$ is green and $3$ is blue.</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://5NV1Wyni.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>Below is an example of a painting process that is not valid, as in the second step the segment <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1 3</span> is not single colour, and thus may not be repainted with colour $2$.</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://gGpvd7r7.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>In the second example, Alice must first paint segment <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0 3</span> with colour $1$ and then segment <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1 2</span> with colour $2$. </p>
