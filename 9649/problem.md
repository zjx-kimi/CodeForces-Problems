## Description

<div><p>Vasya is very upset that many people on the Net mix uppercase and lowercase letters in one word. That's why he decided to invent an extension for his favorite browser that would change the letters' register in every word so that it either only consisted of lowercase letters or, vice versa, only of uppercase ones. At that as little as possible letters should be changed in the word. For example, the word <span class="tex-font-style-tt">HoUse</span> must be replaced with <span class="tex-font-style-tt">house</span>, and the word <span class="tex-font-style-tt">ViP</span> — with <span class="tex-font-style-tt">VIP</span>. If a word contains an equal number of uppercase and lowercase letters, you should replace all the letters with lowercase ones. For example, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">maTRIx</span> should be replaced by <span class="tex-font-style-tt">matrix</span>. Your task is to use the given method on one given word.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> — it consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and possesses the length from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span">100</span>.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the corrected word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span>. If the given word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> has strictly more uppercase letters, make the word written in the uppercase register, otherwise - in the lowercase one.</p></div>

## Input

## Output

<p>Print the corrected word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span>. If the given word <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> has strictly more uppercase letters, make the word written in the uppercase register, otherwise - in the lowercase one.</p>
