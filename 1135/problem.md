## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line has the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\ 000$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1 \le l \le r \le 10^{18}$) — the intervals at which you want to know how many times Ela changes her sports.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output an integer that denotes the answer.</p>
