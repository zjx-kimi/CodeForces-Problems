## Description

<div><p>You are given a tree with $n$ nodes. As a reminder, a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.</p><p>Let $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ be a sequence of integers. Perform the following operation <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly</span> $n$ times: </p><ul> <li> Select an <span class="tex-font-style-bf">unerased</span> node $u$. Assign $a_u :=$ number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">unerased</span> nodes adjacent to $u$. Then, erase the node $u$ along with all edges that have it as an endpoint. </li></ul><p>For each integer $k$ from $1$ to $n$, find the number, modulo $998\,244\,353$, of different sequences $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ that satisfy the following conditions:</p><ul> <li> it is possible to obtain $a$ by performing the aforementioned operations <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly</span> $n$ times in some order. </li><li> $\operatorname{gcd}(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n) = k$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$).</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$) indicating there is an edge between vertices $u$ and $v$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print $n$ integers in a single line, where for each $k$ from $1$ to $n$, the $k$-th integer denotes the answer when $\operatorname{gcd}$ equals to $k$.</p>

<p>In the first test case, </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://fFppSKKX.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><ul> <li> If we delete the nodes in order $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$ or $1 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 2$, then the obtained sequence will be $a = [2, 0, 0]$ which has $\operatorname{gcd}$ equals to $2$. </li><li> If we delete the nodes in order $2 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 3$, then the obtained sequence will be $a = [1, 1, 0]$ which has $\operatorname{gcd}$ equals to $1$. </li><li> If we delete the nodes in order $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$, then the obtained sequence will be $a = [1, 0, 1]$ which has $\operatorname{gcd}$ equals to $1$. </li><li> If we delete the nodes in order $2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$ or $3 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 1$, then the obtained sequence will be $a = [0, 1, 1]$ which has $\operatorname{gcd}$ equals to $1$. </li></ul><p>Note that here we are counting the number of different sequences, not the number of different orders of deleting nodes.</p>
