## Description

<div><p>Tokitsukaze is arranging a meeting. There are $n$ rows and $m$ columns of seats in the meeting hall.</p><p>There are exactly $n \cdot m$ students attending the meeting, including several naughty students and several serious students. The students are numerated from $1$ to $n\cdot m$. The students will enter the meeting hall in order. When the $i$-th student enters the meeting hall, he will sit in the $1$-st column of the $1$-st row, and the students who are already seated will move back one seat. Specifically, the student sitting in the $j$-th ($1\leq j \leq m-1$) column of the $i$-th row will move to the $(j+1)$-th column of the $i$-th row, and the student sitting in $m$-th column of the $i$-th row will move to the $1$-st column of the $(i+1)$-th row.</p><p>For example, there is a meeting hall with $2$ rows and $2$ columns of seats shown as below:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://pl2CqR2L.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>There will be $4$ students entering the meeting hall in order, represented as a binary string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1100</span>", of which '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>' represents naughty students and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>' represents serious students. The changes of seats in the meeting hall are as follows:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://R1CIQHgp.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Denote a row or a column good if and only if there is at least one serious student in this row or column.

## Input

<p>The first contains a single positive integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>For each test case, the first line contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($1 \leq n,m \leq 10^6$; $1 \leq n \cdot m \leq 10^6$), denoting there are $n$ rows and $m$ columns of seats in the meeting hall.</p><p>The second line contains a binary string $s$ of length $n \cdot m$, consisting only of zeros and ones. If $s_i$ equal to '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>' represents the $i$-th student is a naughty student, and $s_i$ equal to '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>' represents the $i$-th student is a serious student.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single line with $n \cdot m$ integers&nbsp;— the number of good rows and columns just after the $i$-th student enters the meeting hall.</p>
