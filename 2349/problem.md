## Description

<div><p>Imagine a board with $n$ pins put into it, the $i$-th pin is located at $(x_i, y_i)$. For simplicity, we will restrict the problem to the case where the pins are placed in vertices of a convex polygon.</p><p>Then, take a non-stretchable string of length $l$, and put it around all the pins. Place a pencil inside the string and draw a curve around the pins, trying to pull the string in every possible direction. The picture below shows an example of a string tied around the pins and pulled by a pencil (a point $P$).</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://HjbzIQkC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Your task is to find an area inside this curve. Formally, for a given convex polygon $S$ and a length $l$ let's define a <span class="tex-font-style-underline">fiber shape</span> $F(S, l)$ as a set of points $t$ such that the perimeter of the convex hull of $S \cup \{t\}$ does not exceed $l$. Find an area of $F(S, l)$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $l$ ($3 \le n \le 10^4$; $1 \le l \le 8 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices of the polygon $S$ and the length of the string. Next $n$ lines contain integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^5 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^5$)&nbsp;— coordinates of polygon's vertices in counterclockwise order. All internal angles of the polygon are strictly less than $\pi$. The length $l$ exceeds the perimeter of the polygon by at least $10^{-3}$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output a single floating-point number&nbsp;— the area of the fiber shape $F(S, l)$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. </p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $l$ ($3 \le n \le 10^4$; $1 \le l \le 8 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices of the polygon $S$ and the length of the string. Next $n$ lines contain integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^5 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^5$)&nbsp;— coordinates of polygon's vertices in counterclockwise order. All internal angles of the polygon are strictly less than $\pi$. The length $l$ exceeds the perimeter of the polygon by at least $10^{-3}$.</p>

## Output

<p>Output a single floating-point number&nbsp;— the area of the fiber shape $F(S, l)$. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error doesn't exceed $10^{-6}$. </p>
