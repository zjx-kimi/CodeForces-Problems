## Description

<div><p>Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one of the given <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs from the others in evenness. Help Bob — to check his answers, he needs a program that among the given <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> numbers finds one that is different in evenness.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">3 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">3 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — amount of numbers in the task. The second line contains <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> space-separated natural numbers, not exceeding 100. It is guaranteed, that exactly one of these numbers differs from the others in evenness.</p>

## Output

<p>Output index of number that differs from the others in evenness. Numbers are numbered from 1 in the input order.</p>
