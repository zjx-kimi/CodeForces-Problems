## Description

<div><p>Two little greedy bears have found two pieces of cheese in the forest of weight <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i></span> grams, correspondingly. The bears are so greedy that they are ready to fight for the larger piece. That's where the fox comes in and starts the dialog: "Little bears, wait a little, I want to make your pieces equal" "Come off it fox, how are you going to do that?", the curious bears asked. "It's easy", said the fox. "If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by two, then I can eat exactly a half of the piece. If the mass of a certain piece is divisible by three, then I can eat exactly two-thirds, and if the mass is divisible by five, then I can eat four-fifths. I'll eat a little here and there and make the pieces equal". </p><p>The little bears realize that the fox's proposal contains a catch. But at the same time they realize that they can not make the two pieces equal themselves. So they agreed to her proposal, but on one condition: the fox should make the pieces equal as quickly as possible. Find the minimum number of operations the fox needs to make pieces equal.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>). </p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>.

## Input

<p>The first line contains two space-separated integers <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>). </p>

## Output

<p>If the fox is lying to the little bears and it is impossible to make the pieces equal, print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>. Otherwise, print the required minimum number of operations. If the pieces of the cheese are initially equal, the required number is 0.</p>
