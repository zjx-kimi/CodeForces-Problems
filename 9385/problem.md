## Description

<div><p>Petya started to attend programming lessons. On the first lesson his task was to write a simple program.

The program's input is exactly one string, it should return the output as a single string, resulting after the program's processing the initial string.</p><p>Help Petya cope with this easy task.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line represents input string of Petya's program. This string only consists of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters and its length is from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span">100</span>, inclusive.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the resulting string. It is guaranteed that this string is not empty.</p></div>
