## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ startups. Startups can be <span class="tex-font-style-it">active</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-it">acquired</span>. If a startup is <span class="tex-font-style-it">acquired</span>, then that means it has exactly one <span class="tex-font-style-it">active</span> startup that it is following. An active startup can have arbitrarily many acquired startups that are following it. An active startup cannot follow any other startup.</p><p>The following steps happen until there is exactly one active startup. The following sequence of steps takes exactly 1 day.</p><ol> <li> Two distinct active startups $A$, $B$, are chosen uniformly at random. </li><li> A fair coin is flipped, and with equal probability, $A$ acquires $B$ or $B$ acquires $A$ (i.e. if $A$ acquires $B$, then that means $B$'s state changes from active to acquired, and its starts following $A$). </li><li> When a startup changes from active to acquired, all of its previously acquired startups become active. </li></ol><p>For example, the following scenario can happen: Let's say $A$, $B$ are active startups. $C$, $D$, $E$ are acquired startups under $A$, and $F$, $G$ are acquired startups under $B$:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="155px" src="file://KzVlOSgd.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="378px"><p><span class="tex-font-size-small">Active startups are shown in red.</span> </p></center><p>If $A$ acquires $B$, then the state will be $A$, $F$, $G$ are active startups. $C$, $D$, $E$, $B$ are acquired startups under $A$. $F$ and $G$ have no acquired startups:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="155px" src="file://26DgqY7O.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="333px"> </center><p>If instead, $B$ acquires $A$, then the state will be $B$, $C$, $D$, $E$ are active startups. $F$, $G$, $A$ are acquired startups under $B$. $C$, $D$, $E$ have no acquired startups:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="159px" src="file://PUKl9rtZ.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="370px"> </center><p>You are given the initial state of the startups.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 500$), the number of startups.</p><p>The next line will contain $n$ space-separated integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($a_i = -1$ or $1 \leq a_i \leq n$). If $a_i = -1$, then that means startup $i$ is active. Otherwise, if $1 \leq a_i \leq n$, then startup $i$ is acquired, and it is currently following startup $a_i$. It is guaranteed if $a_i \not= -1$, then $a_{a_i} =-1$ (that is, all startups that are being followed are active).</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer, the expected number of days needed for the process to end with exactly one active startup, modulo $10^9+7$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first sample, there are three active startups labeled $1$, $2$ and $3$, and zero acquired startups. Here's an example of how one scenario can happen</p><ol> <li> Startup $1$ acquires startup $2$ (This state can be represented by the array $[-1, 1, -1]$) </li><li> Startup $3$ acquires startup $1$ (This state can be represented by the array $[3, -1, -1]$) </li><li> Startup $2$ acquires startup $3$ (This state can be represented by the array $[-1, -1, 2]$). </li><li> Startup $2$ acquires startup $1$ (This state can be represented by the array $[2, -1, 2]$). </li></ol><p>At this point, there is only one active startup, and this sequence of steps took $4$ days. It can be shown the expected number of days is $3$.</p><p>For the second sample, there is only one active startup, so we need zero days.</p><p>For the last sample, remember to take the answer modulo $10^9+7$.</p>
