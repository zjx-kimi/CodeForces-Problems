## Description

<div><p>Let $T$ be a tree on $n$ vertices. Consider a graph $G_0$, initially equal to $T$. You are given a sequence of $q$ updates, where the $i$-th update is given as a pair of two distinct integers $u_i$ and $v_i$. </p><p>For every $i$ from $1$ to $q$, we define the graph $G_i$ as follows: </p><ul> <li> If $G_{i-1}$ contains an edge $\{u_i, v_i\}$, then remove this edge to form $G_i$. </li><li> Otherwise, add this edge to $G_{i-1}$ to form $G_i$. </li></ul> <p>Formally, $G_i := G_{i-1} \triangle \{\{u_i, v_i\}\}$ where $\triangle$ denotes the set <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric_difference">symmetric difference</a>. </p><p>Furthermore, it is guaranteed that $T$ is always a subgraph of $G_i$. In other words, an update never removes an edge of $T$.</p><p>Consider a connected graph $H$ and run a depth-first search on it. One can see that the tree edges (i.e. the edges leading to a not yet visited vertex at the time of traversal) form a spanning tree of the graph $H$. This spanning tree is not generally fixed for a particular graph&nbsp;— it depends on the starting vertex, and on the order in which the neighbors of each vertex are traversed. </p><p>We call vertex $w$ <span class="tex-font-style-it">good</span> if one can order the neighbors of each vertex in such a way that the depth-first search started from $w$ produces $T$ as the spanning tree. For every $i$ from $1$ to $q$, find and report the number of good vertices.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($3 \le n \le 2\cdot 10^5$, $1 \le q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of nodes and the number of updates, respectively.</p><p>Each of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \ne v$)&nbsp;— vertices connected by an edge in $T$. It is guaranteed that this graph is a tree.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \ne v$)&nbsp;— the endpoints of the edge that is added or removed.

It is guaranteed that this graph is a tree.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$, $u \ne v$)&nbsp;— the endpoints of the edge that is added or removed.

## Note

<p>The first sample is depicted in the following figure.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://gq4YBX0F.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>After the first update, $G$ contains all three possible edges. The result of a DFS is as follows: </p><ul> <li> Let the starting vertex be $1$. We have two choices of ordering the neighbors of $1$, either $[2, 3]$ or $[3, 2]$. <ul> <li> If we choose the former, then we reach vertex $2$. Regardless of the ordering of its neighbors, the next visited vertex will be $3$. Thus, the spanning tree generated by this DFS will contain edges $\{1, 2\}$ and $\{2, 3\}$, which does not equal to $T$. </li><li> If we choose the latter, we obtain a spanning tree with edges $\{1, 3\}$ and $\{2, 3\}$. </li></ul> Hence, there is no way of ordering the neighbors of vertices such that the DFS produces $T$, and subsequently $1$ is not a good vertex. </li><li> Let the starting vertex be $2$. We have two choices of traversing its neighbors. If we visit $3$ first, then the spanning tree will consist of edges $\{2,3\}$ and $\{1,3\}$, which is not equal to $T$. If we, however, visit $1$ first, then we can only continue to $3$ from here, and the spanning tree will consist of edges $\{1, 2\}$ and $\{1,3\}$, which equals to $T$. Hence, $2$ is a good vertex. </li><li> The case when we start in the vertex $3$ is symmetrical to starting in $2$, and hence $3$ is a good vertex. </li></ul> Therefore, the answer is $2$.<p>After the second update, the edge between $2$ and $3$ is removed, and $G = T$. It follows that the spanning tree generated by DFS will be always equal to $T$ independent of the choice of the starting vertex. Thus, the answer is $3$.</p><p>In the second sample, the set of good vertices after the corresponding query is: </p><ul> <li> $\{2, 3, 5\}$ </li><li> $\{3, 5\}$ </li><li> $\{3, 4, 5\}$ </li><li> $\{4, 5\}$ </li><li> $\{4, 5, 6\}$ </li><li> $\{5, 6\}$ </li></ul>
