## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree. It contains $n$ vertices, which are numbered from $1$ to $n$. The root is the vertex $1$.</p><p>Each edge has two positive integer values. Thus, two positive integers $a_j$ and $b_j$ are given for each edge.</p><p>Output $n-1$ numbers $r_2, r_3, \dots, r_n$, where $r_i$ is defined as follows.</p><p>Consider the path from the root (vertex $1$) to $i$ ($2 \le i \le n$). Let the sum of the costs of $a_j$ along this path be $A_i$. Then $r_i$ is equal to the length of the maximum prefix of this path such that the sum of $b_j$ along this prefix does not exceed $A_i$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://XyOTeK61.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">   <span class="tex-font-size-small">Example for $n=9$.
