<div><p>You are given a grid with $n$ rows and $m$ columns. We denote the square on the $i$-th ($1\le i\le n$) row and $j$-th ($1\le j\le m$) column by $(i, j)$ and the number there by $a_{ij}$.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 1000$) &nbsp;— the size of the grid.</p><p>Each of the following $n$ lines contains $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer on the $i$-th line is $a_{ij}$ ($a_{ij} = 1$ or $-1$) &nbsp;— the element in the cell $(i, j)$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n\cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print "YES" if there exists a path from the top left to the bottom right that adds up to $0$, and "NO" otherwise. You can output each letter in any case.</p>
