## Description

<div><p>You found an antique box in your warehouse and decided to open it. The moment you open the box, it traps you into a cursed game where you are playing against a demon. The game consists of $333$ rounds and you have to win all rounds in order to escape. The demon also gives you $999$ coins that you can use throughout all rounds.</p><p>Note that in this problem, denote cell $(r, c)$ of a grid as the cell in row $r$ and column $c$ of the grid.</p><p>Before the start of each round, the demon will prepare a <span class="tex-font-style-it">secret paper</span>, which can be represented as a grid with $3$ rows and $3$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $3$. The demon will secretly put a hole in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">one or more cells</span>, and you are not aware which cells have a hole in it. Then, the round starts with the demon giving you an <span class="tex-font-style-bf">odd</span> integer $N$ ($3 \leq N \leq 33$).</p><p>Within each round, you can ask the demon several queries, each costing you one coin. For each query, you are allowed to give the demon <span class="tex-font-style-it">your paper</span>, which can be represented as a grid with $N$ rows and $N$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $N$. Each cell is coloured either black or white by you.</p><p>For each of your query, the demon will calculate a binary <span class="tex-font-style-it">result grid</span> with $N - 2$ rows and $N - 2$ columns, both numbered from $1$ to $N - 2$. The value on cell $(r, c)$ of the result grid is filled as follows.</p><ul> <li> The demon will put the secret paper on top of your paper such that the cell $(r + i - 1, c + j - 1)$ of your paper aligns with the cell $(i, j)$ of the secret paper, for $1 \leq i, j \leq 3$. </li><li> The demon can only see the colour of the cell in your paper if the corresponding cell in the secret paper has a hole in it. </li><li> The value on cell $(r, c)$ of the result grid is $1$ if there is an odd number of black cells that it can see through the holes, or $0$ otherwise. </li></ul><p>You win the round if the result grid consists of only the values $1$. Otherwise, the demon will give you the result grid as a feedback, and the round continues.</p><p>If you have spent all the coins and still did not win all the rounds, then you will be trapped forever. Escape the cursed game!</p></div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>Each round is started with an odd integer $N$ ($3 \leq N \leq 33$) which can be read through standard input.</p><p>Then, for each query that you give to the demon, you can output $N$ lines to standard output. Each of the $N$ lines consists of $N$ characters. The $c$-th character of the $r$-th line represents the colour of cell $(r, c)$ in your paper. The character should be <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> if $(r, c)$ is coloured black, or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> if coloured white.</p><p>The demon will reply with one line consisting of a string, which can be read through standard input.</p><ul> <li> If the string is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">CORRECT</span>, then you win the current round and the next round (if exists) will immediately start.  </li><li> If the string is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">INCORRECT</span>, then the demon will give you $N - 2$ more lines which can be read through standard input. Each of the $N - 2$ lines consists of $N - 2$ characters, representing the binary result grid as explained in the description. </li></ul><p>The demon prepares the secret paper before the start of each round. In other words, <span class="tex-font-style-bf">the grader is NOT adaptive</span>. There will be at least one hole in the secret paper.</p><p>The total number of queries across all $333$ rounds should not exceed $999$. If you exceed the maximum number of queries, you should terminate your program with $0$ to receive the verdict <span class="tex-font-style-it">Wrong Answer</span>. If you do not terminate, the judging result would be undefined because your program is reading from a closed stream.</p><p>Do not forget to flush output buffers after each output. In C you can use <span class="tex-font-style-tt">fflush(stdout)</span>. In C++ you can use <span class="tex-font-style-tt">fflush(stdout)</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">cout Â« flush</span>. In Java you can use method <span class="tex-font-style-tt">flush</span> for output stream, for example, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">System.out.flush()</span>. In Python you can use <span class="tex-font-style-tt">stdout.flush()</span>.</p></div>

## Note

<p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Sample Interaction #1</span></p><p>The following interaction only shows $2$ rounds. The actual interaction stays until you win all $333$ rounds or you run out of coins.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://08lLMNXC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="265px"> </center><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Explanation for the sample interaction #1</span></p><p>For the first round, the following illustration shows how the demon finds the value in cell $(1, 1)$ of the result grid for the first and second queries. The grey-colored square represents the secret paper, and the circles represent the holes. In the first query, there are $4$ black cells that can be seen through the holes, therefore the value in cell $(1, 1)$ of the result grid is $0$. In the second query, there are $5$ black cells that can be seen through the holes, therefore the value in cell $(1, 1)$ of the result grid is $1$. As the result grid consists of only <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>, the first round ends.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://EUVuEHQZ.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="227px"> </center><p>For the second round, the following illustration shows how the demon find the value in cell $(2, 1)$ of the result grid for the first query. Since there are $2$ black cells that can be seen through the holes, the value in cell $(2, 1)$ is $0$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://isrjP9tg.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="189px"> </center>
