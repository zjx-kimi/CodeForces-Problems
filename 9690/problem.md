## Description

<div><p>The commanding officers decided to drop a nuclear bomb on the enemy's forces. You are ordered to determine the power of the warhead that needs to be used.</p><p>The enemy has <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> strategically important objects. Their positions are known due to the intelligence service. The aim of the strike is to deactivate at least <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> important objects of the enemy. The bombing impact point is already determined and has coordinates of <span class="tex-span">[<i>X</i><sub class="lower-index">0</sub>; <i>Y</i><sub class="lower-index">0</sub>]</span>.</p><p>The nuclear warhead is marked by the estimated impact radius <span class="tex-span"><i>R</i> ≥ 0</span>. All the buildings that are located closer than <span class="tex-span"><i>R</i></span> to the bombing epicentre will be destroyed. All the buildings that are located further than <span class="tex-span"><i>R</i></span> from the epicentre, can also be deactivated with some degree of probability. Let's assume that <span class="tex-span"><i>D</i></span> is the distance between a building and the epicentre. This building's deactivation probability <span class="tex-span"><i>P</i>(<i>D</i>, <i>R</i>)</span> is calculated according to the following formula: </p><center class="tex-equation"><img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://NxBP7jrW.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></center> We should regard <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://n8a4qmLj.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> as <span class="tex-span"><i>e</i><sup class="upper-index"><i>a</i></sup></span>, where <span class="tex-span"><i>e</i> ≈ 2.7182818284590452353602874713527</span><p>If the estimated impact radius of the warhead is equal to zero, then all the buildings located in the impact point will be completely demolished and all the rest of important objects will not be damaged.</p><p>The commanding officers want the probability of failing the task to be no more than <span class="tex-span">ε</span>. Nuclear warheads are too expensive a luxury, that's why you have to minimise the estimated impact radius of the warhead. </p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> which represents the number of the enemy's objects (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 100</span>).

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> which represents the number of the enemy's objects (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 100</span>). The second line contains two integers: <span class="tex-span"><i>K</i></span> is the required number of deactivated objects, and <span class="tex-span">ε</span> is the maximally permitted probability of not completing the task, given in per mils (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>K</i> ≤ <i>N</i></span>, <span class="tex-span">1 ≤ ε ≤ 999</span>). The third line contains <span class="tex-span"><i>X</i><sub class="lower-index">0</sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>Y</i><sub class="lower-index">0</sub></span> which are the coordinates of the strike impact point. The next <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> lines contain two numbers <span class="tex-span"><i>X</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>Y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> each which are the coordinates of every strategically important object. All the coordinates are integer, their absolute values do not exceed <span class="tex-span">1000</span>.</p><p>Let us remind you that there are a thousand per mils in unity (number one).</p><p>There can be several objects in one point.</p>

## Output

<p>Print the sought estimated impact radius of the warhead. The absolute or relative measure of the inaccuracy of your answer should not exceed <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index"> - 6</sup></span>.</p>
