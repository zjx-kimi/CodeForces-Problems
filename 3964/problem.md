## Description

<div><p>The Cybermen have again outwitted the Daleks! Unfortunately, this time the Daleks decided to abandon these tasks altogether, which means the Doctor has to deal with them.</p><p>The Doctor can handle the Daleks on his own, but Heidi now has to make sure that the Cybermen are kept busy with this next task.</p><p>There are $k$ rings on a plane. For each ring, $n$ points are uniformly sampled with a small random noise. The task is to recover the rings given only the noisy samples.</p><p>The rings and the samples are generated as follows. The center of a ring is uniformly sampled from a disk of radius $1\,000\,000$ centered at the origin, and the radius of the ring is uniformly sampled from $[250\,000, 750\,000]$. Let $R$ be a ring with center $(x, y)$ and radius $r$. To sample a point from $R$, an angle $\theta$ is uniformly sampled from $[0, 2\pi]$ and a distance $d$ is uniformly sampled from $[0.9r, 1.1r]$. The coordinates of the sampled point are then $(x+d\cos(\theta), y+d\sin(\theta))$ rounded to the closest integers.</p><p>The distance between rings is measured by their Hausdorff distance. In our case, the distance between two rings $R_1, R_2$ can be written as follow. Let $d$ be the distance between the two centers and $r_1, r_2$ be the radii. Then the distance is $$dist(R_1, R_2)=\max(\min(d_{--}, d_{-+}),\min(d_{+-}, d_{++}), \min(d_{--}, d_{+-}), \min(d_{-+}, d_{++}))$$, where $d_{++}=|d+r_1+r_2|$, $d_{+-}=|d+r_1-r_2|$, $d_{-+}=|d-r_1+r_2|$, $d_{--}=|d-r_1-r_2|$.</p><p>We say that a ring $R_0$ is recovered if one of the rings $R$ in the output has Hausdorff distance less than $100\,000$ from $R_0$. </p><p>An output is accepted if all the rings are recovered. It is guaranteed that the distances between any two rings is greater than $600\,000$.</p><p>Remember that a human can very easily solve this task, so make sure that no human traitors are helping the Cybermen complete this task.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 4$), the number of rings.</p><p>The second line contains an integer $n$ ($100 \leq n \leq 1\,000$), the number of samples per ring.</p><p>The following $n \times k$ lines contain the samples, one sample per line.</p><p>Each line contains a pair of integers $x_i, y_i$, where $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the $i$-th sample.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $k$ lines, each describing a single ring.</p><p>For each line, print three real numbers $x_i, y_i, r_i$, where $(x_i, y_i)$ and $r_i$ are the coordinates and the radius of the $i$-th ring.</p><p>The order of the rings does not matter.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 4$), the number of rings.</p><p>The second line contains an integer $n$ ($100 \leq n \leq 1\,000$), the number of samples per ring.</p><p>The following $n \times k$ lines contain the samples, one sample per line.</p><p>Each line contains a pair of integers $x_i, y_i$, where $(x_i, y_i)$ are the coordinates of the $i$-th sample.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $k$ lines, each describing a single ring.</p><p>For each line, print three real numbers $x_i, y_i, r_i$, where $(x_i, y_i)$ and $r_i$ are the coordinates and the radius of the $i$-th ring.</p><p>The order of the rings does not matter.</p>

<p>Here is how one of tests with $k=4$ and $n=100$ looks like. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://r8JAliuV.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>You can download the sample input and output <a href="//assets.codeforces.com/rounds/1184/c1.zip">here</a>.</p>
