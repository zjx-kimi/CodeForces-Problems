## Description

<div><p>Polycarp plays a well-known computer game (we won't mention its name). In this game, he can craft tools of two types — shovels and swords. To craft a shovel, Polycarp spends two sticks and one diamond; to craft a sword, Polycarp spends two diamonds and one stick.</p><p>Each tool can be sold for exactly one emerald. How many emeralds can Polycarp earn, if he has $a$ sticks and $b$ diamonds?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The only line of each test case contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($0 \le a, b \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of sticks and the number of diamonds, respectively.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case print one integer — the maximum number of emeralds Polycarp can earn.</p>
