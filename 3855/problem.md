## Description

<div><p>You are given integer $n$. You have to arrange numbers from $1$ to $2n$, using each of them exactly once, on the circle, so that the following condition would be satisfied:</p><p>For every $n$ consecutive numbers on the circle write their sum on the blackboard. Then any two of written on the blackboard $2n$ numbers differ not more than by $1$.</p><p>For example, choose $n = 3$. On the left you can see an example of a valid arrangement: $1 + 4 + 5 = 10$, $4 + 5 + 2 = 11$, $5 + 2 + 3 = 10$, $2 + 3 + 6 = 11$, $3 + 6 + 1 = 10$, $6 + 1 + 4 = 11$, any two numbers differ by at most $1$. On the right you can see an invalid arrangement: for example, $5 + 1 + 6 = 12$, and $3 + 2 + 4 = 9$, $9$ and $12$ differ more than by $1$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://SEWRvfkm.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first and the only line contain one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>If there is no solution, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" in the first line. </p><p>If there is a solution, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" in the first line. In the second line output $2n$ numbers&nbsp;— numbers from $1$ to $2n$ in the order they will stay in the circle. Each number should appear only once. If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first and the only line contain one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$).</p>

## Output

<p>If there is no solution, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" in the first line. </p><p>If there is a solution, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" in the first line. In the second line output $2n$ numbers&nbsp;— numbers from $1$ to $2n$ in the order they will stay in the circle. Each number should appear only once. If there are several solutions, you can output any of them.</p>





```input1
3
```




```input2
4
```




```output1
YES
1 4 5 2 3 6
```




```output2
NO
```



## Note

<p>Example from the statement is shown for the first example. </p><p>It can be proved that there is no solution in the second example.</p>
