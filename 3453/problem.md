## Description

<div><p>Today, Osama gave Fadi an integer $X$, and Fadi was wondering about the minimum possible value of $max(a, b)$ such that $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. Both $a$ and $b$ should be positive integers.</p><p>$LCM(a, b)$ is the smallest positive integer that is divisible by both $a$ and $b$. For example, $LCM(6, 8) = 24$, $LCM(4, 12) = 12$, $LCM(2, 3) = 6$.</p><p>Of course, Fadi immediately knew the answer. Can you be just like Fadi and find any such pair?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first and only line contains an integer $X$ ($1 \le X \le 10^{12}$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, such that the value of $max(a, b)$ is minimum possible and $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first and only line contains an integer $X$ ($1 \le X \le 10^{12}$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print two positive integers, $a$ and $b$, such that the value of $max(a, b)$ is minimum possible and $LCM(a, b)$ equals $X$. If there are several possible such pairs, you can print any.</p>
