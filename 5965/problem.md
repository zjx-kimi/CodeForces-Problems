## Description

<div><p>It's been long after the events of the previous problems, and Karen has now moved on from student life and is looking to relocate to a new neighborhood.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://gSpnFEUS.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>The neighborhood consists of <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> houses in a straight line, labelled <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> from left to right, all an equal distance apart.</p><p>Everyone in this neighborhood loves peace and quiet. Because of this, whenever a new person moves into the neighborhood, he or she always chooses the house whose minimum distance to any occupied house is maximized. If there are multiple houses with the maximum possible minimum distance, he or she chooses the leftmost one.</p><p>Note that the first person to arrive always moves into house <span class="tex-span">1</span>.</p><p>Karen is the <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span>-th person to enter this neighborhood. If everyone, including herself, follows this rule, which house will she move into?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first and only line of input contains two integers, <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">18</sup></span>), describing the number of houses in the neighborhood, and that Karen was the <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span>-th person to move in, respectively.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output a single integer on a line by itself, the label of the house Karen will move into.</p></div>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, there are <span class="tex-span">6</span> houses in the neighborhood, and Karen is the fourth person to move in:</p><ol> <li> The first person moves into house <span class="tex-span">1</span>. </li><li> The second person moves into house <span class="tex-span">6</span>. </li><li> The third person moves into house <span class="tex-span">3</span>. </li><li> The fourth person moves into house <span class="tex-span">2</span>. </li></ol><p>In the second test case, there are <span class="tex-span">39</span> houses in the neighborhood, and Karen is the third person to move in:</p><ol> <li> The first person moves into house <span class="tex-span">1</span>. </li><li> The second person moves into house <span class="tex-span">39</span>. </li><li> The third person moves into house <span class="tex-span">20</span>. </li></ol>
