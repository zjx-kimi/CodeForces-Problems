## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree with $n$ nodes, labeled from $1$ to $n$. The tree is rooted at node $1$. The parent of the $i$-th node is $p_i$. A leaf is node with no children. For a given set of leaves $L$, let $f(L)$ denote the smallest connected subgraph that contains all leaves $L$.</p><p>You would like to partition the leaves such that for any two different sets $x, y$ of the partition, $f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are disjoint. </p><p>Count the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $998244353$. Two ways are different if there are two leaves such that they are in the same set in one way but in different sets in the other.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of nodes in the tree.</p><p>The next line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i &lt; i$). </p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer, the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $998244353$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of nodes in the tree.</p><p>The next line contains $n-1$ integers $p_2, p_3, \ldots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i &lt; i$). </p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer, the number of ways to partition the leaves, modulo $998244353$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, the leaf nodes are $2,3,4,5$. The ways to partition the leaves are in the following image <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://0tt9pWNC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>In the second example, the only leaf is node $10$ so there is only one partition. Note that node $1$ is not a leaf.</p>
