During his education an interesting situation happened, after which William started to listen to homework assignments much more attentively. What follows is the correct formal description of the homework assignment:</p><p>You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ only consisting of characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>". There are $q$ queries of format ($pos, c$), meaning replacing the element of string $s$ at position $pos$ with character $c$. After each query you must output the minimal number of characters in the string, which have to be replaced, so that the string doesn't contain string "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">substring</span>. A valid replacement of a character is replacing it with "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>".</p><p>A string $x$ is a substring of a string $y$ if $x$ can be obtained from $y$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ $(1 \le n, q \le 10^5)$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains the string $s$, consisting of characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>".</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains an integer $i$ and character $c$ $(1 \le i \le n)$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $c$ value is "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>".</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ $(1 \le n, q \le 10^5)$, the length of the string and the number of queries, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains the string $s$, consisting of characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>".</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains an integer $i$ and character $c$ $(1 \le i \le n)$, index and the value of the new item in the string, respectively. It is guaranteed that character's $c$ value is "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">a</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">b</span>" or "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">c</span>".</p>

## Output

<p>For each query output the minimal number of characters that would have to be replaced so that the string doesn't contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</p>





```input1

## Note

<p>Let's consider the state of the string after each query: </p><ol> <li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abcabcabc</span>". In this case $3$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bbcaccabb</span>". This string does not contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</li><li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bbcabcabc</span>". In this case $2$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bbcbbcbbc</span>". This string does not contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</li><li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bccabcabc</span>". In this case $2$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bccbbcbbc</span>". This string does not contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</li><li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcaabcabc</span>". In this case $2$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcabbcbbc</span>". This string does not contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</li><li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcabbcabc</span>". In this case $1$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcabbcabb</span>". This string does not contain "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">abc</span>" as a substring.</li><li> $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcabccabc</span>". In this case $2$ replacements can be performed to get, for instance, string $s =$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">bcabbcabb</span>".
