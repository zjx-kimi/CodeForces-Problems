## Description

<div><p>Winters are just damn freezing cold in Nvodsk! That's why a group of <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> friends prefers to take a taxi, order a pizza and call girls. The phone numbers in the city consist of three pairs of digits (for example, 12-34-56). Each friend has a phonebook of size <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (that's the number of phone numbers). We know that taxi numbers consist of six identical digits (for example, 22-22-22), the numbers of pizza deliveries should necessarily be decreasing sequences of six different digits (for example, 98-73-21), all other numbers are the girls' numbers.</p><p>You are given your friends' phone books. Calculate which friend is best to go to when you are interested in each of those things (who has maximal number of phone numbers of each type). </p><p>If the phone book of one person contains some number two times, you should count it <span class="tex-font-style-bf">twice</span>. That is, each number should be taken into consideration the number of times it occurs in the phone book.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of friends. </p><p>Then follow <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> data blocks that describe each friend's phone books. Each block is presented in the following form: first goes the line that contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and string <span class="tex-span"><i>name</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span">0 ≤ <i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of phone numbers in the phone book of the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th friend and the name of the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th friend. The name is a non-empty sequence of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, containing no more than <span class="tex-span">20</span> characters. Next <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> lines contain numbers as "XX-XX-XX", where X is arbitrary digits from <span class="tex-span">0</span> to <span class="tex-span">9</span>.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In the first line print the phrase "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">If you want to call a taxi, you should call: </span>".

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of friends. </p><p>Then follow <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> data blocks that describe each friend's phone books. Each block is presented in the following form: first goes the line that contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and string <span class="tex-span"><i>name</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span">0 ≤ <i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of phone numbers in the phone book of the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th friend and the name of the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th friend. The name is a non-empty sequence of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, containing no more than <span class="tex-span">20</span> characters. Next <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> lines contain numbers as "XX-XX-XX", where X is arbitrary digits from <span class="tex-span">0</span> to <span class="tex-span">9</span>.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line print the phrase "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">If you want to call a taxi, you should call: </span>". Then print names of all friends whose phone books contain maximal number of taxi phone numbers. </p><p>In the second line print the phrase "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">If you want to order a pizza, you should call: </span>". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of pizza phone numbers. </p><p>In the third line print the phrase "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">If you want to go to a cafe with a wonderful girl, you should call: </span>". Then print names of all friends who have maximal number of girls' phone numbers. </p><p>Print the names in the order in which <span class="tex-font-style-bf">they are given in the input data</span>. Separate two consecutive names with a comma and a space. Each line should end with exactly one point. For clarifications concerning the output form, see sample tests.

## Note

<p>In the first sample you are given four friends. <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Fedorov</span>'s phone book contains one taxi number and one pizza delivery number, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Melnikov</span>'s phone book only has <span class="tex-span">3</span> numbers of girls, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Rogulenko</span>'s one has <span class="tex-span">6</span> taxi numbers and one pizza delivery number, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Kaluzhin</span>'s one contains <span class="tex-span">2</span> taxi numbers and one pizza delivery number.</p><p>Thus, if you need to order a taxi, you should obviously call <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Rogulenko</span>, if you need to order a pizza you should call anybody of the following: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Rogulenko</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Fedorov</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Kaluzhin</span> (each of them has one number). <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Melnikov</span> has maximal number of phone numbers of girls. </p>
