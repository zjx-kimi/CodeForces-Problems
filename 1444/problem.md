## Description

<div><p>One day Masha was walking in the park and found a graph under a tree... Surprised? Did you think that this problem would have some logical and reasoned story? No way! So, the problem...</p><p>Masha has an oriented graph which $i$-th vertex contains some positive integer $a_i$. Initially Masha can put a coin at some vertex. In one operation she can move a coin placed in some vertex $u$ to any other vertex $v$ such that there is an oriented edge $u \to v$ in the graph. Each time when the coin is placed in some vertex $i$, Masha write down an integer $a_i$ in her notebook (in particular, when Masha initially puts a coin at some vertex, she writes an integer written at this vertex in her notebook). Masha wants to make exactly $k - 1$ operations in such way that the maximum number written in her notebook is as small as possible.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le k \le 10^{18}$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the numbers written in graph vertices.</p><p>Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u \ne v \le n$)&nbsp;— it means that there is an edge $u \to v$ in the graph.</p><p>It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer&nbsp;— the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.</p><p>If Masha won't be able to perform $k - 1$ operations, print $-1$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \le k \le 10^{18}$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices and edges in the graph, and the number of operation that Masha should make.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the numbers written in graph vertices.</p><p>Each of the following $m$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u \ne v \le n$)&nbsp;— it means that there is an edge $u \to v$ in the graph.</p><p>It's guaranteed that graph doesn't contain loops and multi-edges.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer&nbsp;— the minimum value of the maximum number that Masha wrote in her notebook during optimal coin movements.</p><p>If Masha won't be able to perform $k - 1$ operations, print $-1$.</p>

## Note

<p>Graph described in the first and the second examples is illustrated below.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://gfoKOuPp.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the first example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $1$. After that she can perform three operations: $1 \to 3$, $3 \to 4$ and $4 \to 5$. Integers $1, 2, 3$ and $4$ will be written in the notepad.</p><p>In the second example Masha can initially put a coin at vertex $2$. After that she can perform $99$ operations: $2 \to 5$, $5 \to 6$, $6 \to 2$, $2 \to 5$, and so on. Integers $10, 4, 5, 10, 4, 5, \ldots, 10, 4, 5, 10$ will be written in the notepad.</p><p>In the third example Masha won't be able to perform $4$ operations.</p>
