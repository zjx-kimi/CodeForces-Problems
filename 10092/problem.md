## Description

<div><p>A newly discovered organism can be represented as a set of cells on an infinite grid. There is a coordinate system on the grid such that each cell has two integer coordinates $x$ and $y$. A cell with coordinates $x=a$ and $y=b$ will be denoted as $(a, b)$.</p><p>Initially, the organism consists of a single cell $(0, 0)$. Then zero or more <span class="tex-font-style-it">divisions</span> can happen. In one division, a cell $(a, b)$ is removed and replaced by two cells $(a+1, b)$ and $(a, b+1)$.</p><p>For example, after the first division, the organism always consists of two cells $(1, 0)$ and $(0, 1)$, and after the second division, it is either the three cells $(2, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(0, 1)$, or the three cells $(1, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(0, 2)$.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">A division of a cell $(a, b)$ can only happen if the cells $(a+1, b)$ and $(a, b+1)$ are not yet part of the organism.</span> For example, the cell $(1, 0)$ cannot divide if the organism currently consists of the three cells $(1, 0)$, $(1, 1)$ and $(0, 2)$, since the cell $(1, 1)$ that would be one of the results of this division is already part of the organism.</p><p>You are given a set of forbidden cells ${(c_i, d_i)}$. Is it possible for the organism to contain none of those cells after zero or more divisions? </p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. The descriptions of the $t$ test cases follow.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$)&nbsp;— the number of forbidden cells.</p><p>The next $n$ lines contain two integers each. The $i$-th of such lines contains $c_i$ and $d_i$ ($0 \le c_i, d_i \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the coordinates of the $i$-th forbidden cell. It is guaranteed that all forbidden cells are distinct.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of values of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^6$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print $\texttt{YES}$ if it is possible for the organism to contain no forbidden cells after zero or more divisions. Otherwise, print $\texttt{NO}$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">first test case</span>, dividing the following cells in the following order creates an organism without any forbidden cells: $(0, 0)$, $(1, 0)$, $(1, 1)$, $(0, 1)$, $(2, 1)$, $(2, 2)$, $(1, 2)$, $(1, 1)$. The following picture demonstrates how the organism changes during this process:</p><center><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://qBEbgbo8.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="614px"></center><p>In the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">second test case</span>, you can see that, surprisingly, any organism always has at least one cell in the $0 \le x, y \le 3$ square, no matter how many divisions we do.</p>
