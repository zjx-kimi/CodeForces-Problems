## Description

<div><p>A rare article in the Internet is posted without a possibility to comment it. On a Polycarp's website each article has comments feed.</p><p>Each comment on Polycarp's website is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase letters of English alphabet. Comments have tree-like structure, that means each comment except root comments (comments of the highest level) has exactly one parent comment.</p><p>When Polycarp wants to save comments to his hard drive he uses the following format. Each comment he writes in the following format: </p><ul> <li> at first, the text of the comment is written; </li><li> after that the number of comments is written, for which this comment is a parent comment (i.&nbsp;e. the number of the replies to this comments); </li><li> after that the comments for which this comment is a parent comment are written (the writing of these comments uses the same algorithm). </li></ul> All elements in this format are separated by single comma. Similarly, the comments of the first level are separated by comma.<p>For example, if the comments look like:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://jUtCWYHu.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>then the first comment is written as "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">hello,2,ok,0,bye,0</span>", the second is written as "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">test,0</span>", the third comment is written as "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0</span>". The whole comments feed is written as: "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">hello,2,ok,0,bye,0,test,0,one,1,two,2,a,0,b,0</span>". For a given comments feed in the format specified above print the comments in a different format: </p><ul> <li> at first, print a integer <span class="tex-span"><i>d</i></span>&nbsp;— the maximum depth of nesting comments; </li><li> after that print <span class="tex-span"><i>d</i></span> lines, the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th of them corresponds to nesting level <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>; </li><li> for the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th row print comments of nesting level <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span> in the order of their appearance in the Policarp's comments feed, separated by space. </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains non-empty comments feed in the described format. It consists of uppercase and lowercase letters of English alphabet, digits and commas. </p><p>It is guaranteed that each comment is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase English characters. Each of the number of comments is integer (consisting of at least one digit), and either equals <span class="tex-span">0</span> or does not contain leading zeros.</p><p>The length of the whole string does not exceed <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">6</sup></span>.
