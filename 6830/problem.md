## Description

<div><p>Cat Noku has obtained a map of the night sky. On this map, he found a constellation with <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> stars numbered from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>. For each <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>, the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th star is located at coordinates <span class="tex-span">(<i>x</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>)</span>. No two stars are located at the same position.</p><p>In the evening Noku is going to take a look at the night sky. He would like to find three distinct stars and form a triangle. The triangle must have positive area. In addition, all other stars must lie strictly outside of this triangle. He is having trouble finding the answer and would like your help. Your job is to find the indices of three stars that would form a triangle that satisfies all the conditions. </p><p>It is guaranteed that there is no line such that all stars lie on that line. It can be proven that if the previous condition is satisfied, there exists a solution to this problem.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">3 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100 000</span>).</p><p>Each of the next <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span"> - 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup> ≤ <i>x</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p><p>It is guaranteed that no two stars lie at the same point, and there does not exist a line such that all stars lie on that line.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print three distinct integers on a single line&nbsp;— the indices of the three points that form a triangle that satisfies the conditions stated in the problem.</p><p>If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">3 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100 000</span>).</p><p>Each of the next <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span"> - 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup> ≤ <i>x</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>, <i>y</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p><p>It is guaranteed that no two stars lie at the same point, and there does not exist a line such that all stars lie on that line.</p>

## Output

<p>Print three distinct integers on a single line&nbsp;— the indices of the three points that form a triangle that satisfies the conditions stated in the problem.</p><p>If there are multiple possible answers, you may print any of them.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first sample, we can print the three indices in any order.</p><p>In the second sample, we have the following picture. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://Nm45gjsS.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Note that the triangle formed by starts <span class="tex-span">1</span>, <span class="tex-span">4</span> and <span class="tex-span">3</span> doesn't satisfy the conditions stated in the problem, as point <span class="tex-span">5</span> is not strictly outside of this triangle (it lies on it's border).</p>
