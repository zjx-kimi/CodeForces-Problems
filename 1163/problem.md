## Description

## Input

<p>Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $q = 1$) — the length of the array and the number of queries.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — array elements.</p><p>$i$-th of the next $q$ lines of each test case contains two integers $L_i$ and $R_i$ ($1 \leq L_i \leq R_i \leq n$) — the boundaries in which we need to find the segment.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that $L_1 = 1$ and $R_1 = n$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case print $q$ pairs of numbers $L_i \leq l \leq r \leq R_i$ such that the value $f(l, r)$ is maximum and among such the length $r - l + 1$ is minimum. If there are several correct answers, print any of them.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, $f(1, 1) = 0 - 0 = 0$.</p><p>In the second test case, $f(1, 1) = 5 - 5 = 0$, $f(2, 2) = 10 - 10 = 0$. Note that $f(1, 2) = (10 + 5) - (10 \oplus 5) = 0$, but we need to find a subsegment with the minimum length among the maximum values of $f(l, r)$. So, only segments $[1, 1]$ and $[2, 2]$ are the correct answers.</p><p>In the fourth test case, $f(2, 3) = (12 + 8) - (12 \oplus 8) = 16$. </p><p>There are two correct answers in the fifth test case, since $f(2, 3) = f(3, 4)$ and their lengths are equal.</p>
