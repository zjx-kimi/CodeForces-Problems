## Description

<div><p>You are given an array $a$ consisting of $n$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> positive integers.</p><p>Let's consider an infinite integer set $S$ which contains all integers $x$ that satisfy at least one of the following conditions:</p><ol><li> $x = a_i$ for some $1 \leq i \leq n$.</li><li> $x = 2y + 1$ and $y$ is in $S$.</li><li> $x = 4y$ and $y$ is in $S$.</li></ol><p>For example, if $a = [1,2]$ then the $10$ smallest elements in $S$ will be $\{1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,11,12\}$.</p><p>Find the number of elements in $S$ that are strictly smaller than $2^p$. Since this number may be too large, print it modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \leq n, p \leq 2 \cdot 10^5)$.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that all the numbers in $a$ are distinct.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer, the number of elements in $S$ that are strictly smaller than $2^p$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $p$ $(1 \leq n, p \leq 2 \cdot 10^5)$.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that all the numbers in $a$ are distinct.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer, the number of elements in $S$ that are strictly smaller than $2^p$. Remember to print it modulo $10^9 + 7$. </p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, the elements smaller than $2^4$ are $\{1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12, 13, 15\}$.</p><p>In the second example, the elements smaller than $2^7$ are $\{5,11,20,23,39,41,44,47,79,80,83,89,92,95\}$.</p>
