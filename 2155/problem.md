## Input

No friendship is listed twice.</p><p>The next line contains the integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 2\cdot {10}^{5}$) — the number of queries. </p><p>The next $q$ lines contain the queries themselves, each query has one of the following three formats. </p><ul> <li> $1$ $u$ $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$, $u \ne v$) — add a friendship between $u$ and $v$.

It is guaranteed that $u$ and $v$ are friends at this moment. </li><li> $3$ — print the answer to the process described in the statement. </li></ul>

## Output

<p>For each type $3$ query print one integer to a new line. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one type $3$ query.</p>

## Note

<p>Consider the first example. In the first type 3 query, we have the diagram below.</p><p>In the first round of the process, noble $1$ is weaker than all of his friends ($2$ and $3$), and is thus killed. No other noble is vulnerable in round 1. In round 2, noble $3$ is weaker than his only friend, noble $4$, and is therefore killed. At this point, the process ends, and the answer is $2$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://feqW2Whc.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second type 3 query, the only surviving noble is $4$.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The second example consists of only one type $3$ query. In the first round, two nobles are killed, and in the second round, one noble is killed. The final answer is $1$, since only one noble survives.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://sMg3Bzh1.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
