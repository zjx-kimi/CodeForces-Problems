## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">This is an interactive problem!</span></p><p>salyg1n gave Alice a set $S$ of $n$ distinct integers $s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_n$ ($0 \leq s_i \leq 10^9$). Alice decided to play a game with this set against Bob. The rules of the game are as follows:</p><ul> <li> Players take turns, with Alice going first.<p> </p></li><li> In one move, Alice adds one number $x$ ($0 \leq x \leq 10^9$) to the set $S$. The set $S$ must not contain the number $x$ at the time of the move.</li><li> In one move, Bob removes one number $y$ from the set $S$. The set $S$ must contain the number $y$ at the time of the move. Additionally, the number $y$ must be <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly smaller</span> than the last number added by Alice.</li><li> The game ends when Bob cannot make a move or after $2 \cdot n + 1$ moves (in which case Alice's move will be the last one).</li><li> The result of the game is $\operatorname{MEX}\dagger(S)$ ($S$ at the end of the game).</li><li> Alice aims to maximize the result, while Bob aims to minimize it. </li></ul><p>Let $R$ be the result when both players play optimally. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">In this problem, you play as Alice against the jury program playing as Bob.</span> Your task is to implement a strategy for Alice such that the result of the game is always at least $R$.</p><p>$\dagger$ $\operatorname{MEX}$ of a set of integers $c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_k$ is defined as the smallest non-negative integer $x$ which does not occur in the set $c$. For example, $\operatorname{MEX}(\{0, 1, 2, 4\})$ $=$ $3$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^5$) - the number of test cases.</p></div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>The interaction between your program and the jury program begins with reading an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^5$) - the size of the set $S$ before the start of the game.</p><p>Then, read one line - $n$ distinct integers $s_i$ $(0 \leq s_1 &lt; s_2 &lt; \ldots &lt; s_n \leq 10^9)$ - the set $S$ given to Alice.</p><p>To make a move, output an integer $x$ ($0 \leq x \leq 10^9$) - the number you want to add to the set $S$. $S$ must not contain $x$ at the time of the move. Then, read one integer $y$ $(-2 \leq y \leq 10^9)$. </p><ul> <li> If $0 \leq y \leq 10^9$ - Bob removes the number $y$ from the set $S$. It's your turn!</li><li> If $y$ $=$ $-1$ - the game is over. After this, proceed to handle the next test case or terminate the program if it was the last test case.</li><li> Otherwise, $y$ $=$ $-2$. This means that you made an invalid query. Your program should immediately terminate to receive the verdict <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Wrong Answer</span>. Otherwise, it may receive any other verdict. </li></ul><p>After printing a query do not forget to output the end of line and flush the output. Otherwise, you will get <span class="tex-font-style-tt">Idleness limit exceeded</span>. To do this, use:</p><ul><li> <span class="tex-font-style-tt">fflush(stdout)</span> or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">cout.flush()</span> in C++;</li><li> <span class="tex-font-style-tt">System.out.flush()</span> in Java;</li><li> <span class="tex-font-style-tt">flush(output)</span> in Pascal;</li><li> <span class="tex-font-style-tt">stdout.flush()</span> in Python;</li><li> see the documentation for other languages.</li></ul> It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$.<p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Do not attempt to hack this problem.</span></p></div>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, the set $S$ changed as follows:</p><p>{$1, 2, 3, 5, 7$} $\to$ {$1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8$} $\to$ {$1, 2, 3, 5, 8$} $\to$ {$1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 57$} $\to$ {$1, 2, 3, 8, 57$} $\to$ {$0, 1, 2, 3, 8, 57$}. In the end of the game, $\operatorname{MEX}(S) = 4$, $R = 4$.</p><p>In the second test case, the set $S$ changed as follows:</p><p>{$0, 1, 2$} $\to$ {$0, 1, 2, 3$} $\to$ {$1, 2, 3$} $\to$ {$0, 1, 2, 3$}.
