## Description

<div><p>Kurt reaches nirvana when he finds the product of all the digits of some positive integer. Greater value of the product makes the nirvana deeper.</p><p>Help Kurt find the maximum possible product of digits among all integers from $1$ to $n$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only input line contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^9$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the maximum product of digits among all integers from $1$ to $n$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only input line contains the integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2\cdot10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print the maximum product of digits among all integers from $1$ to $n$.</p>





```input1
390
```




```input2
7
```




```input3
1000000000
```




```output1
216
```




```output2
7
```




```output3
387420489
```



## Note

<p>In the first example the maximum product is achieved for $389$ (the product of digits is $3\cdot8\cdot9=216$).</p><p>In the second example the maximum product is achieved for $7$ (the product of digits is $7$).</p><p>In the third example the maximum product is achieved for $999999999$ (the product of digits is $9^9=387420489$).</p>
