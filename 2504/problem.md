The shelf is considered <span class="tex-font-style-it">beautiful</span> if all books of the same color are next to each other.</p><p>In one operation you can take one book from any position on the shelf and move it to the right end of the shelf.</p><p>What is the minimum number of operations you need to make the shelf beautiful?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of books.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the book colors.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output the minimum number of operations to make the shelf beautiful.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of books.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the book colors.</p>

## Output

<p>Output the minimum number of operations to make the shelf beautiful.</p>





```input1

## Note

<p>In the first example, we have the bookshelf $[1, 2, 2, 1, 3]$ and can, for example: </p><ol> <li> take a book on position $4$ and move to the right end: we'll get $[1, 2, 2, 3, 1]$; </li><li> take a book on position $1$ and move to the right end: we'll get $[2, 2, 3, 1, 1]$. </li></ol><p>In the second example, we can move the first book to the end of the bookshelf and get $[2,2,1,1,1]$.</p>
