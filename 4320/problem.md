## Description

<div><p>You are given 3 qubits which are guaranteed to be in one of the two states:</p><ul><li> $|\psi_0\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big( |100\rangle + \omega |010\rangle + \omega^2|001\rangle \big)$, or</li><li> $|\psi_1\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}} \big( |100\rangle + \omega^2 |010\rangle + \omega|001\rangle \big)$, where $\omega = e^{2i\pi/3}$.</li></ul><p>Your task is to perform necessary operations and measurements to figure out which state it was and to return 0 if it was $|\psi_0\rangle$ state or 1 if it was $|\psi_1\rangle $ state. The state of the qubits after the operations does not matter.</p><p>You have to implement an operation which takes an array of 3 qubits as an input and returns an integer. Your code should have the following signature:</p><pre class="verbatim">namespace Solution {<br>    open Microsoft.Quantum.Primitive;<br>    open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;<br><br>    operation Solve (qs : Qubit[]) : Int {<br>        // your code here<br>    }<br>}</pre></div>
