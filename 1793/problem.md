The $y$ coordinate for the first line is $0$ and for the second line is $h$.</p><p>The next two lines contain the description of the points on two vertical sides. First, an integer $k$ ($2 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of points. Then, $k$ integers $y_1 &lt; y_2 &lt; \dots &lt; y_k$ ($0 &lt; y_i &lt; h$)&nbsp;— the $y$ coordinates of the points in the ascending order.

## Note

<p>The points in the first testcase of the example: </p><ul> <li> $(1, 0)$, $(2, 0)$; </li><li> $(2, 8)$, $(3, 8)$, $(4, 8)$; </li><li> $(0, 1)$, $(0, 4)$, $(0, 6)$; </li><li> $(5, 4)$, $(5, 5)$. </li></ul><p>The largest triangle is formed by points $(0, 1)$, $(0, 6)$ and $(5, 4)$&nbsp;— its area is $\frac{25}{2}$. Thus, the doubled area is $25$. Two points that are on the same side are: $(0, 1)$ and $(0, 6)$.</p>
