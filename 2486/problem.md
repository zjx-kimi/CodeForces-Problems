## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ cities and $m$ bidirectional roads in the country. The roads in the country form an undirected weighted graph. The graph <span class="tex-font-style-bf">is not guaranteed to be connected</span>. Each road has it's own parameter $w$. You can travel through the roads, but the government made a new law: you can only go through two roads at a time (go from city $a$ to city $b$ and then from city $b$ to city $c$) and you will have to pay $(w_{ab} + w_{bc})^2$ money to go through those roads. Find out whether it is possible to travel from city $1$ to every other city $t$ and what's the minimum amount of money you need to get from $1$ to $t$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>First line contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq min(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)$).</p><p>Next $m$ lines each contain three integers $v_i$, $u_i$, $w_i$ ($1 \leq v_i, u_i \leq n$, $1 \leq w_i \leq 50$, $u_i \neq v_i$). It's guaranteed that there are no multiple edges, i.e. for any edge $(u_i, v_i)$ there are no other edges $(u_i, v_i)$ or $(v_i, u_i)$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For every city $t$ print one integer. If there is no correct path between $1$ and $t$ output $-1$. Otherwise print out the minimum amount of money needed to travel from $1$ to $t$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>First line contains two integers $n$, $m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq min(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}, 2 \cdot 10^5)$).</p><p>Next $m$ lines each contain three integers $v_i$, $u_i$, $w_i$ ($1 \leq v_i, u_i \leq n$, $1 \leq w_i \leq 50$, $u_i \neq v_i$). It's guaranteed that there are no multiple edges, i.e. for any edge $(u_i, v_i)$ there are no other edges $(u_i, v_i)$ or $(v_i, u_i)$.</p>

## Output

<p>For every city $t$ print one integer. If there is no correct path between $1$ and $t$ output $-1$. Otherwise print out the minimum amount of money needed to travel from $1$ to $t$.</p>
