## Description

<div><p>So we got bored and decided to take our own guess at how would "Inception" production go if the budget for the film had been terribly low.</p><p>The first scene we remembered was the one that features the whole city bending onto itself:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://x1brkTsM.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>It feels like it will require high CGI expenses, doesn't it? Luckily, we came up with a similar-looking scene which was a tiny bit cheaper to make.</p><p>Firstly, forget about 3D, that's hard and expensive! The city is now represented as a number line (<span class="tex-font-style-it">infinite to make it easier, of course</span>).</p><p>Secondly, the city doesn't have to look natural at all. There are $n$ buildings on the line. Each building is a square $1 \times 1$. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Buildings are numbered from $1$ to $n$ in ascending order of their positions.</span> Lower corners of building $i$ are at integer points $a_i$ and $a_i + 1$ of the number line. Also the distance between any two neighbouring buildings $i$ and $i + 1$ doesn't exceed $d$ (<span class="tex-font-style-it">really, this condition is here just to make the city look not that sparse</span>). Distance between some neighbouring buildings $i$ and $i + 1$ is calculated from the lower right corner of building $i$ to the lower left corner of building $i + 1$.</p><p>Finally, curvature of the bend is also really hard to simulate! Let the bend at some integer coordinate $x$ be performed with the following algorithm. Take the ray from $x$ to $+\infty$ and all the buildings which are on this ray and start turning the ray and the buildings counter-clockwise around point $x$. At some angle some building will touch either another building or a part of the line. You have to stop bending there (<span class="tex-font-style-it">implementing buildings crushing is also not worth its money</span>). </p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Let's call the angle between two rays in the final state the terminal angle $\alpha_x$.</span></p><p>The only thing left is to decide what integer point $x$ is the best to start bending around. Fortunately, we've already chosen $m$ candidates to perform the bending.</p><p>So, can you please help us to calculate terminal angle $\alpha_x$ for each bend $x$ from our list of candidates?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le d \le 7000$) — the number of buildings and the maximum distance between any pair of neighbouring buildings, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($a_1 = 0$, $0 &lt; a_{i + 1} - a_i \le d + 1$) — coordinates of left corners of corresponding buildings in ascending order.</p><p>The third line contains single integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candidates.</p><p>The fourth line contains $m$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$ ($0 \le x_i \le a_n + 1$, $x_i &lt; x_{i + 1}$) — the coordinates of bends you need to calculate terminal angles for in ascending order.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $m$ numbers. For each bend $x_i$ print terminal angle $\alpha_{x_i}$ (in radians).</p><p>Your answer is considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{-9}$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $|a - b| \le 10^{-9}$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integer numbers $n$ and $d$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le d \le 7000$) — the number of buildings and the maximum distance between any pair of neighbouring buildings, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($a_1 = 0$, $0 &lt; a_{i + 1} - a_i \le d + 1$) — coordinates of left corners of corresponding buildings in ascending order.</p><p>The third line contains single integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of candidates.</p><p>The fourth line contains $m$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_m$ ($0 \le x_i \le a_n + 1$, $x_i &lt; x_{i + 1}$) — the coordinates of bends you need to calculate terminal angles for in ascending order.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $m$ numbers. For each bend $x_i$ print terminal angle $\alpha_{x_i}$ (in radians).</p><p>Your answer is considered correct if its absolute error does not exceed $10^{-9}$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $|a - b| \le 10^{-9}$.</p>

## Note

<p>Here you can see the picture of the city for the first example and the bend at position $2$ for it. The angle you need to measure is marked blue. You can see that it's equal to $\frac \pi 4$.</p><p>You can see that no pair of neighbouring buildings have distance more than $4$ between them. $d = 4$ would also suffice for that test.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://SxxRzPHb.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
