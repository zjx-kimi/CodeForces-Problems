## Description

<div><p>You are a lover of bacteria. You want to raise some bacteria in a box. </p><p>Initially, the box is empty. Each morning, you can put any number of bacteria into the box. And each night, every bacterium in the box will split into two bacteria. You hope to see exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> bacteria in the box at some moment. </p><p>What is the minimum number of bacteria you need to put into the box across those days?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line containing one integer <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>The only line containing one integer: the answer.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line containing one integer <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>x</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p>

## Output

<p>The only line containing one integer: the answer.</p>





```input1
5

```




```input2
8

```




```output1
2

```




```output2
1

```



## Note

<p>For the first sample, we can add one bacterium in the box in the first day morning and at the third morning there will be <span class="tex-span">4</span> bacteria in the box. Now we put one more resulting <span class="tex-span">5</span> in the box. We added <span class="tex-span">2</span> bacteria in the process so the answer is <span class="tex-span">2</span>.</p><p>For the second sample, we can put one in the first morning and in the 4-th morning there will be <span class="tex-span">8</span> in the box. So the answer is <span class="tex-span">1</span>.</p>
