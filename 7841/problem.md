## Description

<div><p>You are given two strings $A$ and $B$ representing essays of two students who are suspected cheaters. For any two strings $C$, $D$ we define their similarity score $S(C,D)$ as $4\cdot LCS(C,D) - |C| - |D|$, where $LCS(C,D)$ denotes the length of the Longest Common <span class="tex-font-style-bf">Subsequence</span> of strings $C$ and $D$. </p><p>You believe that only some part of the essays could have been copied, therefore you're interested in their <span class="tex-font-style-bf">substrings</span>.</p><p>Calculate the maximal similarity score over all pairs of substrings. More formally, output maximal $S(C, D)$ over all pairs $(C, D)$, where $C$ is some substring of $A$, and $D$ is some substring of $B$. </p><p>If $X$ is a string, $|X|$ denotes its length.</p><p>A string $a$ is a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">substring</span> of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the beginning and several (possibly, zero or all) characters from the end.</p><p>A string $a$ is a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">subsequence</span> of a string $b$ if $a$ can be obtained from $b$ by deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) characters. </p><p>Pay attention to the difference between the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">substring</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-bf">subsequence</span>, as they both appear in the problem statement. </p><p>You may wish to read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_common_subsequence_problem">Wikipedia page about the Longest Common Subsequence problem</a>.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 5000$)&nbsp;— lengths of the two strings $A$ and $B$. </p><p>The second line contains a string consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters&nbsp;— string $A$.</p><p>The third line contains a string consisting of $m$ lowercase Latin letters&nbsp;— string $B$. </p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output maximal $S(C, D)$ over all pairs $(C, D)$, where $C$ is some substring of $A$, and $D$ is some substring of $B$. </p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two positive integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n, m \leq 5000$)&nbsp;— lengths of the two strings $A$ and $B$. </p><p>The second line contains a string consisting of $n$ lowercase Latin letters&nbsp;— string $A$.</p><p>The third line contains a string consisting of $m$ lowercase Latin letters&nbsp;— string $B$. </p>

## Output

<p>Output maximal $S(C, D)$ over all pairs $(C, D)$, where $C$ is some substring of $A$, and $D$ is some substring of $B$. </p>

## Note

<p>For the first case:</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-tt">abb</span> from the first string and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">abab</span> from the second string have LCS equal to <span class="tex-font-style-tt">abb</span>.</p><p>The result is $S(abb, abab) = (4 \cdot |abb|$) - $|abb|$ - $|abab|$ = $4 \cdot 3 - 3 - 4 = 5$.</p>
