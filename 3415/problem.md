## Description

<div><p>You are given an unweighted tree with $n$ vertices. Recall that a tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles.</p><p>Your task is to choose <span class="tex-font-style-bf">three distinct</span> vertices $a, b, c$ on this tree such that the number of edges which belong to <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at least</span> one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$ is the maximum possible. See the notes section for a better understanding.</p><p>The simple path is the path that visits each vertex at most once.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer number $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree. </p><p>Next $n - 1$ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \le a_i$, $b_i \le n$, $a_i \ne b_i$). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In the first line print one integer $res$ — the maximum number of edges which belong to <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at least</span> one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$.</p><p>In the second line print three integers $a, b, c$ such that $1 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $a \ne, b \ne c, a \ne c$.</p><p>If there are several answers, you can print any.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer number $n$ ($3 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of vertices in the tree. </p><p>Next $n - 1$ lines describe the edges of the tree in form $a_i, b_i$ ($1 \le a_i$, $b_i \le n$, $a_i \ne b_i$). It is guaranteed that given graph is a tree.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line print one integer $res$ — the maximum number of edges which belong to <span class="tex-font-style-bf">at least</span> one of the simple paths between $a$ and $b$, $b$ and $c$, or $a$ and $c$.</p><p>In the second line print three integers $a, b, c$ such that $1 \le a, b, c \le n$ and $a \ne, b \ne c, a \ne c$.</p><p>If there are several answers, you can print any.</p>

## Note

<p>The picture corresponding to the first example (and <span class="tex-font-style-bf">another one correct answer</span>):</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://YiTNlw1U.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>If you choose vertices $1, 5, 6$ then the path between $1$ and $5$ consists of edges $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5)$, the path between $1$ and $6$ consists of edges $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 6)$ and the path between $5$ and $6$ consists of edges $(4, 5), (4, 6)$. The union of these paths is $(1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 5), (4, 6)$ so the answer is $5$. It can be shown that there is no better answer.</p>
