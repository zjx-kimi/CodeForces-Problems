## Description

<div><p>While Mike was walking in the subway, all the stuff in his back-bag dropped on the ground. There were several fax messages among them. He concatenated these strings in some order and now he has string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span>.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://cU5KTiD9.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>He is not sure if this is his own back-bag or someone else's. He remembered that there were exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> messages in his own bag, each was a <span class="tex-font-style-it">palindrome</span> string and all those strings had the same length.</p><p>He asked you to help him and tell him if he has worn his own back-bag. Check if the given string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> is a concatenation of <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> <span class="tex-font-style-it">palindromes</span> of the same length.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input contains string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> containing lowercase English letters (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ |<i>s</i>| ≤ 1000</span>).</p><p>The second line contains integer <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ 1000</span>).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print "YES"(without quotes) if he has worn his own back-bag or "NO"(without quotes) otherwise.</p></div>
