## Description

<div><p>You are the owner of a harvesting field which can be modeled as an infinite line, whose positions are identified by integers.</p><p>It will rain for the next $n$ days. On the $i$-th day, the rain will be centered at position $x_i$ and it will have intensity $p_i$. Due to these rains, some rainfall will accumulate; let $a_j$ be the amount of rainfall accumulated at integer position $j$. Initially $a_j$ is $0$, and it will increase by $\max(0,p_i-|x_i-j|)$ after the $i$-th day's rain.</p><p>A flood will hit your field if, at any moment, there is a position $j$ with accumulated rainfall $a_j&gt;m$.</p><p>You can use a magical spell to erase <span class="tex-font-style-bf">exactly one</span> day's rain, i.e., setting $p_i=0$. For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, check whether in case of erasing the $i$-th day's rain there is no flood.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq 10^9$) — the number of rainy days and the maximal accumulated rainfall with no flood occurring.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \leq x_i,p_i \leq 10^9$) — the position and intensity of the $i$-th day's rain.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output a binary string $s$ length of $n$. The $i$-th character of $s$ is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> if after erasing the $i$-th day's rain there is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">no</span> flood, while it is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>, if after erasing the $i$-th day's rain the flood still happens.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5$, $1 \leq m \leq 10^9$) — the number of rainy days and the maximal accumulated rainfall with no flood occurring.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th of these lines contains two integers $x_i$ and $p_i$ ($1 \leq x_i,p_i \leq 10^9$) — the position and intensity of the $i$-th day's rain.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a binary string $s$ length of $n$. The $i$-th character of $s$ is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span> if after erasing the $i$-th day's rain there is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">no</span> flood, while it is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>, if after erasing the $i$-th day's rain the flood still happens.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, if we do not use the spell, the accumulated rainfall distribution will be like this:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://1tFNWW5a.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>If we erase the third day's rain, the flood is avoided and the accumulated rainfall distribution looks like this:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://Dt1PlVv8.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second test case, since initially the flood will not happen, we can erase any day's rain.</p><p>In the third test case, there is no way to avoid the flood.</p>
