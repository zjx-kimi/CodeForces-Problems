## Description

<div><p>You are given a tree (an undirected connected acyclic graph) consisting of $n$ vertices and $n - 1$ edges. A number is written on each edge, each number is either $0$ (let's call such edges $0$-edges) or $1$ (those are $1$-edges).</p><p>Let's call an ordered pair of vertices $(x, y)$ ($x \ne y$) <span class="tex-font-style-bf">valid</span> if, while traversing the simple path from $x$ to $y$, we never go through a $0$-edge after going through a $1$-edge. Your task is to calculate the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">valid</span> pairs in the tree.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200000$) — the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>Then $n - 1$ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the tree. Each edge is represented by three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $c_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$, $0 \le c_i \le 1$, $x_i \ne y_i$) — the vertices connected by this edge and the number written on it, respectively.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer — the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">valid</span> pairs of vertices.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 200000$) — the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>Then $n - 1$ lines follow, each denoting an edge of the tree. Each edge is represented by three integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and $c_i$ ($1 \le x_i, y_i \le n$, $0 \le c_i \le 1$, $x_i \ne y_i$) — the vertices connected by this edge and the number written on it, respectively.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer — the number of <span class="tex-font-style-bf">valid</span> pairs of vertices.</p>
