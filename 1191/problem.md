## Description

<div><p>Mainak has a convex polygon $\mathcal P$ with $n$ vertices labelled as $A_1, A_2, \ldots, A_n$ in a counter-clockwise fashion. The coordinates of the $i$-th point $A_i$ are given by $(x_i, y_i)$, where $x_i$ and $y_i$ are both integers.</p><p>Further, it is known that the interior angle at $A_i$ is either a right angle or a proper obtuse angle. Formally it is known that: </p><ul> <li> $90 ^ \circ \le \angle A_{i - 1}A_{i}A_{i + 1} &lt; 180 ^ \circ$, $\forall i \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ where we conventionally consider $A_0 = A_n$ and $A_{n + 1} = A_1$. </li></ul><p>Mainak's friend insisted that all points $Q$ such that there exists a chord of the polygon $\mathcal P$ passing through $Q$ with length <span class="tex-font-style-bf">not exceeding</span> $1$, must be coloured $\color{red}{\text{red}}$. </p><p>Mainak wants you to find the area of the coloured region formed by the $\color{red}{\text{red}}$ points.</p><p>Formally, determine the area of the region $\mathcal S = \{Q \in \mathcal{P}$ | $Q \text{ is coloured } \color{red}{\text{red}}\}$.</p><p>Recall that a chord of a polygon is a line segment between two points lying on the boundary (<span class="tex-font-style-it">i.e.</span> vertices or points on edges) of the polygon. </p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($4 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of vertices of a polygon $\mathcal P$.</p><p>The $i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contain two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$) — the coordinates of $A_i$.</p><p>Additional constraint on the input: The vertices form a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">convex</span> polygon and are listed in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">counter-clockwise</span> order.

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($4 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of vertices of a polygon $\mathcal P$.</p><p>The $i$-th line of the next $n$ lines contain two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($-10^9 \le x_i, y_i \le 10^9$) — the coordinates of $A_i$.</p><p>Additional constraint on the input: The vertices form a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">convex</span> polygon and are listed in <span class="tex-font-style-bf">counter-clockwise</span> order. It is also guaranteed that all interior angles are in the range $[90^\circ ; 180^\circ )$.</p>

## Output

<p>Print the area of the region coloured in $\color{red}{\text{red}}$.</p><p>Your answer is considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed $10^{-4}$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $a$, and the jury's answer be $b$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\frac{|a - b|}{\max{(1, |b|)}} \le 10^{-4}$.</p>
