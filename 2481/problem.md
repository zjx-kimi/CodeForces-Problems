## Description

<div><p>You are given a positive (greater than zero) integer $n$.</p><p>You have to represent $n$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) consisting only of ones (digits '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>'). For example, $24 = 11 + 11 + 1 + 1$ and $102 = 111 - 11 + 1 + 1$. </p><p>Among all possible representations, you have to find the one that uses the minimum number of ones in total.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The single line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n &lt; 10^{50}$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one integer $x$ — the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $n$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $x$ ones in total.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The single line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n &lt; 10^{50}$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer $x$ — the minimum number of ones, such that there exist a representation of $n$ as the sum of integers (possibly negative) that uses $x$ ones in total.</p>
