## Description

<div><p>You are given a rooted tree consisting of $n$ vertices numbered from $1$ to $n$. Vertex $1$ is the root of the tree. Each vertex has an integer value. The value of $i$-th vertex is $a_i$. You can do the following operation at most $k$ times.</p><ul> <li> Choose a vertex $v$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">that has not been chosen before</span> and an integer $x$ such that $x$ is a common divisor of the values of all vertices of the subtree of $v$. Multiply by $x$ the value of each vertex in the subtree of $v$. </li></ul><p>What is the maximum possible value of the root node $1$ after at most $k$ operations? Formally, you have to maximize the value of $a_1$.</p><p>A tree is a connected undirected graph without cycles. A rooted tree is a tree with a selected vertex, which is called the root. The subtree of a node $u$ is the set of all nodes $y$ such that the simple path from $y$ to the root passes through $u$. Note that $u$ is in the subtree of $u$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains an integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 50\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.
