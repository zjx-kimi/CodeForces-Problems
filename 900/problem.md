## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of nodes in the tree.</p><p>The next $n-1$ lines of each test case contain two integers each — $u$, $v$ indicating an edge between $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

## Note

<p>Let us find $F(A)$ for the configuration $A = [0,1,0,0,1,1]$ ($A[i]$ denotes the value of node $i$). Initially (at $t = 0$) our tree is as shown in the picture below. In each node, two values are shown: the number and the value of this node. $S(0)$ for this configuration is $3$. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://v7Mpk4TE.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>At $t = 1$ the configuration changes to $[1,0,0,0,0,0]$. The tree looks as shown below. $S(1) = 1$. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://m1Vmchxw.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>At $t = 2$ the configuration changes to $[0,0,0,0,0,0]$. The tree looks as shown below. $S(2) = 0$. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://2qL7iZzE.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>For all $t&gt;2$, the graph remains unchanged, so $S(t)=0$ for all $t &gt; 2$. So, for the initial configuration $A = [0,1,0,0,1,1]$, the value of $F(A) = 3 + 1 = 4$.</p><p>Doing this process for all possible $2^{6}$ configurations yields us an answer of $\textbf{288}$. </p>
