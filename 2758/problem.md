## Description

<div><p>In the snake exhibition, there are $n$ rooms (numbered $0$ to $n - 1$) arranged in a circle, with a snake in each room. The rooms are connected by $n$ conveyor belts, and the $i$-th conveyor belt connects the rooms $i$ and $(i+1) \bmod n$. In the other words, rooms $0$ and $1$, $1$ and $2$, $\ldots$, $n-2$ and $n-1$, $n-1$ and $0$ are connected with conveyor belts.</p><p>The $i$-th conveyor belt is in one of three states:</p><ul> <li> If it is clockwise, snakes can only go from room $i$ to $(i+1) \bmod n$. </li><li> If it is anticlockwise, snakes can only go from room $(i+1) \bmod n$ to $i$. </li><li> If it is off, snakes can travel in either direction. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://igUOl8mo.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Above is an example with $4$ rooms, where belts $0$ and $3$ are off, $1$ is clockwise, and $2$ is anticlockwise.</p><p>Each snake wants to leave its room and come back to it later. A room is <span class="tex-font-style-bf">returnable</span> if the snake there can leave the room, and later come back to it using the conveyor belts. How many such <span class="tex-font-style-bf">returnable</span> rooms are there?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$): the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows. </p><p> The first line of each test case description contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 300\,000$): the number of rooms.</p><p> The next line of each test case description contains a string $s$ of length $n$, consisting of only '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">&lt;</span>', '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">&gt;</span>' and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-</span>'.</p><ul> <li> If $s_{i} = $ '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">&gt;</span>', the $i$-th conveyor belt goes clockwise. </li><li> If $s_{i} = $ '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">&lt;</span>', the $i$-th conveyor belt goes anticlockwise. </li><li> If $s_{i} = $ '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">-</span>', the $i$-th conveyor belt is off. </li></ul><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ among all test cases does not exceed $300\,000$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output the number of returnable rooms.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, all rooms are returnable except room $2$. The snake in the room $2$ is trapped and cannot exit. This test case corresponds to the picture from the problem statement.</p><p> In the second test case, all rooms are returnable by traveling on the series of clockwise belts.</p>
