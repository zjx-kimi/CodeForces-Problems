## Description

<div><p>While resting on the ship after the "Russian Code Cup" a boy named Misha invented an interesting game. He promised to give his quadrocopter to whoever will be the first one to make a rectangular table of size <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i> × <i>m</i></span>, consisting of positive integers such that the sum of the squares of numbers for each row and each column was also a square.</p><p>Since checking the correctness of the table manually is difficult, Misha asks you to make each number in the table to not exceed <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">8</sup></span>.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 100</span>) &nbsp;— the size of the table. </p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the table that meets the condition: <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines containing <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 100</span>) &nbsp;— the size of the table. </p>

## Output

<p>Print the table that meets the condition: <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines containing <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span> integers, separated by spaces. If there are multiple possible answers, you are allowed to print anyone. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one correct answer.</p>
