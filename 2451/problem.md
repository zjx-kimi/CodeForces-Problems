## Description

<div><p>You are given two integers $n$ and $k$. You are asked to choose maximum number of distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ so that there is no subset of chosen numbers with sum equal to $k$.</p><p>A subset of a set is a set that can be obtained from initial one by removing some (possibly all or none) elements of it.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains the number of test cases $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$).</p><p>Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 1000$) — the description of test cases.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer $m$ — the number of chosen integers.</p><p>In the second line output $m$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ — the chosen numbers.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains the number of test cases $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$).</p><p>Each of the next $T$ lines contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le k \le n \le 1000$) — the description of test cases.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case output two lines. In the first line output a single integer $m$ — the number of chosen integers.</p><p>In the second line output $m$ distinct integers from $1$ to $n$ — the chosen numbers.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any. You can print the numbers in any order.</p>
