## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The only difference between easy and hard versions are constraints on $n$ and $k$</span>.</p><p>You are messaging in one of the popular social networks via your smartphone. Your smartphone can show at most $k$ most recent conversations with your friends. Initially, the screen is empty (i.e. the number of displayed conversations equals $0$).</p><p>Each conversation is between you and some of your friends. There is at most one conversation with any of your friends. So each conversation is uniquely defined by your friend.</p><p>You (suddenly!) have the ability to see the future. You know that during the day you will receive $n$ messages, the $i$-th message will be received from the friend with ID $id_i$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$).</p><p>If you receive a message from $id_i$ in the conversation which is currently displayed on the smartphone then nothing happens: the conversations of the screen do not change and do not change their order, you read the message and continue waiting for new messages.</p><p>Otherwise (i.e. if there is no conversation with $id_i$ on the screen):</p><ul> <li> Firstly, if the number of conversations displayed on the screen is $k$, the last conversation (which has the position $k$) is removed from the screen. </li><li> Now the number of conversations on the screen is guaranteed to be less than $k$ and the conversation with the friend $id_i$ is not displayed on the screen. </li><li> The conversation with the friend $id_i$ appears on the first (the topmost) position on the screen and all the other displayed conversations are shifted one position down. </li></ul><p>Your task is to find the list of conversations (in the order they are displayed on the screen) after processing all $n$ messages.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 200)$ — the number of messages and the number of conversations your smartphone can show.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $id_1, id_2, \dots, id_n$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$), where $id_i$ is the ID of the friend which sends you the $i$-th message.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In the first line of the output print one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le min(n, k)$) — the number of conversations shown after receiving all $n$ messages.</p><p>In the second line print $m$ integers $ids_1, ids_2, \dots, ids_m$, where $ids_i$ should be equal to the ID of the friend corresponding to the conversation displayed on the position $i$ after receiving all $n$ messages.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 200)$ — the number of messages and the number of conversations your smartphone can show.</p><p>The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $id_1, id_2, \dots, id_n$ ($1 \le id_i \le 10^9$), where $id_i$ is the ID of the friend which sends you the $i$-th message.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line of the output print one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le min(n, k)$) — the number of conversations shown after receiving all $n$ messages.</p><p>In the second line print $m$ integers $ids_1, ids_2, \dots, ids_m$, where $ids_i$ should be equal to the ID of the friend corresponding to the conversation displayed on the position $i$ after receiving all $n$ messages.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example the list of conversations will change in the following way (in order from the first to last message):</p><ul> <li> $[]$; </li><li> $[1]$; </li><li> $[2, 1]$; </li><li> $[3, 2]$; </li><li> $[3, 2]$; </li><li> $[1, 3]$; </li><li> $[1, 3]$; </li><li> $[2, 1]$. </li></ul><p>In the second example the list of conversations will change in the following way:</p><ul> <li> $[]$; </li><li> $[2]$; </li><li> $[3, 2]$; </li><li> $[3, 2]$; </li><li> $[1, 3, 2]$; </li><li> and then the list will not change till the end. </li></ul>
