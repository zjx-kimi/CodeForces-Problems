## Input

<p>Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n,m \le 100$).</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 10^9$).</p><p>The third line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ ($1 \le b_i \le 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum possible sum of integers written on whiteboards after performing all $m$ operations.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:</p><ol> <li> Choose the $1$-st whiteboard and rewrite the integer written on it to $b_1=4$. </li><li> Choose the $2$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $b_2=5$. </li></ol><p>After performing all operations, the numbers on the three whiteboards are $4$, $5$ and $3$ respectively, and their sum is $12$. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.</p><p>In the second test case, Koxia can perform the operations as follows:</p><ol> <li> Choose the $2$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $b_1=3$. </li><li> Choose the $1$-st whiteboard and rewrite to $b_2=4$. </li><li> Choose the $2$-nd whiteboard and rewrite to $b_3=5$. </li></ol><p>The sum is $4 + 5 = 9$. It can be proven that this is the maximum possible sum achievable.</p>
