## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">The only difference between the easy and hard versions is that tokens of type <span class="tex-font-style-tt">O</span> do not appear in the input of the easy version.</span></p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Errichto gave Monogon the following challenge in order to intimidate him from taking his top contributor spot on Codeforces.</span></p><p>In a Tic-Tac-Toe grid, there are $n$ rows and $n$ columns. Each cell of the grid is either empty or contains a token. There are two types of tokens: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">X</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">O</span>. If there exist three tokens of the same type consecutive in a row or column, it is a winning configuration. Otherwise, it is a draw configuration.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://XnsJBjpu.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> The patterns in the first row are winning configurations.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 100$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1\le n\le 300$) — the size of the grid.</p><p>The following $n$ lines each contain a string of $n$ characters, denoting the initial grid. The character in the $i$-th row and $j$-th column is '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">.</span>' if the cell is empty, or it is the type of token in the cell: '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">X</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">O</span>'.</p><p>It is guaranteed that not all cells are empty.</p><p>The sum of $n$ across all test cases does not exceed $300$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print the state of the grid after applying the operations.</p><p>We have proof that a solution always exists. If there are multiple solutions, print any.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, there are initially three '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">O</span>' consecutive in the second row and the second column. By changing the middle token to '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">X</span>' we make the grid a draw, and we only changed $1\le \lfloor 5/3\rfloor$ token.</p><p>In the second test case, the final grid is a draw. We only changed $8\le \lfloor 32/3\rfloor$ tokens.</p><p>In the third test case, the final grid is a draw. We only changed $7\le \lfloor 21/3\rfloor$ tokens.</p>
