## Description

<div><p>Good job! Now that Heidi is able to distinguish between Poisson and uniform distributions, she is in a good position to actually estimate the populations.</p><p>Can you help Heidi estimate each village's population?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Same as the easy version.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input, containing your (integer) population estimate.</p><p>Your answer is considered correct if it is an integer that falls into the interval <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://iyuEWxzB.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">, where <span class="tex-span"><i>P</i></span> is the real population of the village, used to create the distribution (either Poisson or uniform) from which the marmots drew their answers.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Same as the easy version.</p>

## Output

<p>Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input, containing your (integer) population estimate.</p><p>Your answer is considered correct if it is an integer that falls into the interval <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://iyuEWxzB.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">, where <span class="tex-span"><i>P</i></span> is the real population of the village, used to create the distribution (either Poisson or uniform) from which the marmots drew their answers.</p>
