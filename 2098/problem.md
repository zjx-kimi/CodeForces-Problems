## Description

<div><p>Moamen was drawing a grid of $n$ rows and $10^9$ columns containing only digits $0$ and $1$. Ezzat noticed what Moamen was drawing and became interested in the minimum number of rows one needs to remove to make the grid beautiful.</p><p>A grid is beautiful if and only if for every two consecutive rows there is at least one column containing $1$ in these two rows.</p><p>Ezzat will give you the number of rows $n$, and $m$ segments of the grid that contain digits $1$. Every segment is represented with three integers $i$, $l$, and $r$, where $i$ represents the row number, and $l$ and $r$ represent the first and the last column of the segment in that row.</p><p>For example, if $n = 3$, $m = 6$, and the segments are $(1,1,1)$, $(1,7,8)$, $(2,7,7)$, $(2,15,15)$, $(3,1,1)$, $(3,15,15)$, then the grid is:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://8E5vdGTV.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Your task is to tell Ezzat the minimum number of rows that should be removed to make the grid beautiful.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 3\cdot10^5$).</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $i$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \le i \le n$, $1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$). Each of these $m$ lines means that row number $i$ contains digits $1$ in columns from $l$ to $r$, inclusive.</p><p>Note that the segments <span class="tex-font-style-bf">may overlap</span>.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>In the first line, print a single integer $k$&nbsp;— the minimum number of rows that should be removed.</p><p>In the second line print $k$ distinct integers $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_k$, representing the rows that should be removed ($1 \le r_i \le n$), in any order.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n, m \le 3\cdot10^5$).</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains three integers $i$, $l$, and $r$ ($1 \le i \le n$, $1 \le l \le r \le 10^9$). Each of these $m$ lines means that row number $i$ contains digits $1$ in columns from $l$ to $r$, inclusive.</p><p>Note that the segments <span class="tex-font-style-bf">may overlap</span>.</p>

## Output

<p>In the first line, print a single integer $k$&nbsp;— the minimum number of rows that should be removed.</p><p>In the second line print $k$ distinct integers $r_1, r_2, \ldots, r_k$, representing the rows that should be removed ($1 \le r_i \le n$), in any order.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, the grid is the one explained in the problem statement. The grid has the following properties: </p><ol> <li> The $1$-st row and the $2$-nd row have a common $1$ in the column $7$. </li><li> The $2$-nd row and the $3$-rd row have a common $1$ in the column $15$. </li></ol> As a result, this grid is beautiful and we do not need to remove any row.<p>In the second test case, the given grid is as follows: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ujYQM3xR.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
