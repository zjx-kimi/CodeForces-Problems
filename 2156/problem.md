## Description

<div><p>You are given a directed graph $G$ which can contain loops (edges from a vertex to itself). Multi-edges are absent in $G$ which means that for all ordered pairs $(u, v)$ exists at most one edge from $u$ to $v$. Vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.</p><p>A path from $u$ to $v$ is a sequence of edges such that:</p><ul> <li> vertex $u$ is the start of the first edge in the path; </li><li> vertex $v$ is the end of the last edge in the path; </li><li> for all pairs of adjacent edges next edge starts at the vertex that the previous edge ends on. </li></ul><p>We will assume that the empty sequence of edges is a path from $u$ to $u$.</p><p>For each vertex $v$ output one of four values:</p><ul> <li> $0$, if there are no paths from $1$ to $v$; </li><li> $1$, if there is only one path from $1$ to $v$; </li><li> $2$, if there is more than one path from $1$ to $v$ and the number of paths is finite; </li><li> $-1$, if the number of paths from $1$ to $v$ is infinite. </li></ul><p>Let's look at the example shown in the figure.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://13W5Bppa.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Then:</p><ul> <li> the answer for vertex $1$ is $1$: there is only one path from $1$ to $1$ (path with length $0$); </li><li> the answer for vertex $2$ is $0$: there are no paths from $1$ to $2$; </li><li> the answer for vertex $3$ is $1$: there is only one path from $1$ to $3$ (it is the edge $(1, 3)$); </li><li> the answer for vertex $4$ is $2$: there are more than one paths from $1$ to $4$ and the number of paths are finite (two paths: $[(1, 3), (3, 4)]$ and $[(1, 4)]$); </li><li> the answer for vertex $5$ is $-1$: the number of paths from $1$ to $5$ is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times); </li><li> the answer for vertex $6$ is $-1$: the number of paths from $1$ to $6$ is infinite (the loop can be used in a path many times). </li></ul></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases in the input.

## Input

<p>The first contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases in the input. Then $t$ test cases follow. Before each test case, there is an empty line.</p><p>The first line of the test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 4 \cdot 10^5, 0 \le m \le 4 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— numbers of vertices and edges in graph respectively. The next $m$ lines contain edges descriptions. Each line contains two integers $a_i$, $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the start and the end of the $i$-th edge. The vertices of the graph are numbered from $1$ to $n$. The given graph can contain loops (it is possible that $a_i = b_i$), but cannot contain multi-edges (it is not possible that $a_i = a_j$ and $b_i = b_j$ for $i \ne j$).</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $4 \cdot 10^5$.

## Output

<p>Output $t$ lines. The $i$-th line should contain an answer for the $i$-th test case: a sequence of $n$ integers from $-1$ to $2$.</p>
