## Description

<div><p>There is a country consisting of $n$ cities and $n - 1$ bidirectional roads connecting them such that we can travel between any two cities using these roads. In other words, these cities and roads form a tree.</p><p>There are $m$ bus routes connecting the cities together. A bus route between city $x$ and city $y$ allows you to travel between any two cities in the simple path between $x$ and $y$ with this route.</p><p>Determine if for every pair of cities $u$ and $v$, you can travel from $u$ to $v$ using at most two bus routes.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5, 0 \le m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of cities and the number of bus routes.</p><p>Then $n - 1$ lines follow.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 5 \cdot 10^5, 0 \le m \le 5 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of cities and the number of bus routes.</p><p>Then $n - 1$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $u$ and $v$ denoting a road connecting city $u$ and city $v$ ($1 \le u, v \le n, u \neq v$). It is guaranteed that these cities and roads form a tree.</p><p>Then $m$ lines follow. Each line contains two integers $x$ and $y$ denoting a bus route between city $x$ and city $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$ and the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $5 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" if you can travel between any pair of cities using at most two bus routes.</p><p>Otherwise, output "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>". In the next line, output two cities $x$ and $y$ ($1 \le x, y \le n$) such that it is impossible to reach city $y$ from city $x$ using at most two bus routes.</p><p>You can output the answer in any case (upper or lower). For example, the strings "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yEs</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">yes</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" will be recognized as positive responses.</p>
