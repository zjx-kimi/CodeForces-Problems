## Description

<div><p>The 14th of March was the international day of mathematics, because of number <span class="tex-span">π = 3.1415926..</span>.</p><p>In the occasion of this day Goofy Nephews Unity Organization (GNU) wants to publish the fastest program in math at 1:59:26 AM. </p><p>Now the time is 1:11:11 AM and the project team haven't checked their program yet. Because of shortage of time they want to check their program with some queries. So they hired Hormizd (one of the greatest programmers in world) to write a tester for GNU's new program. Because Hormizd has much more important things to do, he wants you to write a small part of tester and it is reversing the numbers. Help him before 1:59:26.</p><p>We can reverse numbers easily. For example by reversing <span class="tex-span">1234</span> we get <span class="tex-span">4321</span>.</p><p>Note, that if the integer is negative then its reverse would be also negative. For example reverse of <span class="tex-span"> - 123</span> is <span class="tex-span"> - 321</span>.</p><p>Also, you have to delete all the leading zeroes before and after the reverse.</p><p>Given an integer you have to help Hormizd reverse it.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>. It is less than <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">1000</sup></span> by it's absolute value. This integer may have leading zeros. If it had leading zeros you should first omit them and print the reverse of remaining digits. It's guaranteed that input contains less than 10001 characters.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output a single integer, the reverse of the given number.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>. It is less than <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">1000</sup></span> by it's absolute value. This integer may have leading zeros. If it had leading zeros you should first omit them and print the reverse of remaining digits. It's guaranteed that input contains less than 10001 characters.</p>

## Output

<p>Output a single integer, the reverse of the given number. You have to omit leading zeros in the output.</p>
