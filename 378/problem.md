## Description

<div><p>Define a set $A$ as a child of set $B$ if and only if for each element of value $x$ that is in $A$, there exists an element of value $x+1$ that is in $B$.</p><p>Given integers $N$ and $K$. In order to make Chaneka happy, you must find the number of different arrays containing $N$ sets $[S_1, S_2, S_3, \ldots, S_N]$ such that: - Each set can only contain zero or more different integers from $1$ to $K$. - There exists a way to rearrange the order of the array of sets into $[S'_1, S'_2, S'_3, \ldots, S'_N]$ such that $S'_i$ is a child of $S'_{i+1}$ for each $1\leq i\leq N-1$.</p><p>Print the answer modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p><p>Two sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one value that only occurs in one of the two sets.</p><p>Two arrays of sets are considered different if and only if there is at least one index $i$ such that the sets at index $i$ in the two arrays are different.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq N,K \leq 2\cdot10^5$) — the number of sets in the array and the maximum limit for the values in the sets.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>An integer representing the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy the problem condition, modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line contains two integers $N$ and $K$ ($1 \leq N,K \leq 2\cdot10^5$) — the number of sets in the array and the maximum limit for the values in the sets.</p>

## Output

<p>An integer representing the number of different arrays of sets that satisfy the problem condition, modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, there are $11$ different arrays of sets possible, which are: </p><ul> <li> $[\{\}, \{\}]$ </li><li> $[\{\}, \{1\}]$ </li><li> $[\{\}, \{1, 2\}]$ </li><li> $[\{\}, \{2\}]$ </li><li> $[\{1\}, \{\}]$ </li><li> $[\{1\}, \{1, 2\}]$ </li><li> $[\{1\}, \{2\}]$ </li><li> $[\{1, 2\}, \{\}]$ </li><li> $[\{1, 2\}, \{1\}]$ </li><li> $[\{2\}, \{\}]$ </li><li> $[\{2\}, \{1\}]$ </li></ul>
