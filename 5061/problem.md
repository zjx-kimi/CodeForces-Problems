## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ cities and $m$ roads in Berland. Each road connects a pair of cities. The roads in Berland are one-way.</p><p>What is the minimum number of new roads that need to be built to make all the cities reachable from the capital?</p><p>New roads will also be one-way.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 5000, 0 \le m \le 5000, 1 \le s \le n$) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital.

## Input

<p>The first line of input consists of three integers $n$, $m$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 5000, 0 \le m \le 5000, 1 \le s \le n$) — the number of cities, the number of roads and the index of the capital. Cities are indexed from $1$ to $n$.</p><p>The following $m$ lines contain roads: road $i$ is given as a pair of cities $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u_i \ne v_i$). For each pair of cities $(u, v)$, there can be at most one road from $u$ to $v$. Roads in opposite directions between a pair of cities are allowed (i.e. from $u$ to $v$ and from $v$ to $u$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer — the minimum number of extra roads needed to make all the cities reachable from city $s$. If all the cities are already reachable from $s$, print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>.</p>
