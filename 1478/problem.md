## Description

<div><p>You are given a directed acyclic graph, consisting of $n$ vertices and $m$ edges. The vertices are numbered from $1$ to $n$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices and the number of edges of the graph.</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le n$; $v \neq u$)&nbsp;— the description of an edge.</p><p>The given edges form a valid directed acyclic graph. There are no multiple edges.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer&nbsp;— the maximum possible size of a <span class="tex-font-style-it">cute</span> set $S$ after you remove some edges from the graph and both indegrees and outdegrees of all vertices either decrease or remain equal to $0$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, you can remove edges $(1, 2)$ and $(2, 3)$. $\mathit{in} = [0, 1, 2]$, $\mathit{out} = [2, 1, 0]$. $\mathit{in'} = [0, 0, 1]$, $\mathit{out'} = [1, 0, 0]$. You can see that for all $v$ the conditions hold. The maximum <span class="tex-font-style-it">cute</span> set $S$ is formed by vertices $1$ and $3$. They are still connected directly by an edge, so there is a path between them.</p><p>In the second example, there are no edges. Since all $\mathit{in}_v$ and $\mathit{out}_v$ are equal to $0$, leaving a graph with zero edges is allowed. There are $5$ <span class="tex-font-style-it">cute</span> sets, each contains a single vertex. Thus, the maximum size is $1$.</p><p>In the third example, you can remove edges $(7, 1)$, $(2, 4)$, $(1, 3)$ and $(6, 2)$. The maximum <span class="tex-font-style-it">cute</span> set will be $S = \{7, 3, 2\}$. You can remove edge $(7, 3)$ as well, and the answer won't change.</p><p>Here is the picture of the graph from the third example: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://yMcRiMwV.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
