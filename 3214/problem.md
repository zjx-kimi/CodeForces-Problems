## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">Unfortunately, a mistake was found in the proof of the author's solution to this problem. Currently, we don't know the absolutely correct solution. However, you can solve this task, but if your solution passes all the tests, it is not guaranteed to be correct. If your solution has passed all the tests and you are sure that it is correct, you can write to one of the contest authors about it.</span></p><p><span class="tex-font-style-it"> Surely you all read the book "Alice in Wonderland". In this task, Nastya got to the country of Three strange Bees. The bees are strange because their honeycombs are pentagonal. Nastya got there illegally, so she wants bees not to catch her.

You play for bees. Firstly, you choose the vertices where you put the bees. Then Nastya chooses another vertex in which she will initially appear.

For the first time, $3$ vertices displayed will indicate which vertices you originally placed bees on. In response, you will receive the vertex where the jury placed Nastya. Each next $3$ vertices will indicate where the $3$ bees move at your turn. Each of the bees can, regardless of other bees, both remain at the current vertex and move along the edge.

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ $(4 \leq n \leq 5000)$ and $m$ $(n \leq m \leq 3n)$ &nbsp;— the number of vertices and edges in the graph.</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ $(1 \leq v, u \leq n)$, which mean that there is an edge between the vertices $v$ and $u$. It is guaranteed that the graph is connected, does not contain loops that the degree of any vertex does not exceed $3$ and a cycle of length no more than $5$ passes through each edge.
