## Description

<div><p>One beautiful July morning a terrible thing happened in Mainframe: a mean virus Megabyte somehow got access to the memory of his not less mean sister Hexadecimal. He loaded there a huge amount of <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> different natural numbers from 1 to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> to obtain total control over her energy.</p><p>But his plan failed. The reason for this was very simple: Hexadecimal didn't perceive any information, apart from numbers written in binary format. This means that if a number in a decimal representation contained characters apart from 0 and 1, it was not stored in the memory. Now Megabyte wants to know, how many numbers were loaded successfully.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Input data contains the only number <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output the only number — answer to the problem.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Input data contains the only number <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>).</p>

## Output

<p>Output the only number — answer to the problem.</p>





```input1
10

```




```output1
2
```



## Note

<p>For <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> = 10 the answer includes numbers 1 and 10.</p>
