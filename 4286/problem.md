## Description

<div><p>A positive integer $a$ is given. Baron Munchausen claims that he knows such a positive integer $n$ that if one multiplies $n$ by $a$, the sum of its digits decreases $a$ times. In other words, $S(an) = S(n)/a$, where $S(x)$ denotes the sum of digits of the number $x$. </p><p>Find out if what Baron told can be true.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line contains a single integer $a$ ($2 \le a \le 10^3$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>If there is no such number $n$, print $-1$.</p><p>Otherwise print any appropriate positive integer $n$. Your number must not consist of more than $5\cdot10^5$ digits. We can show that under given constraints either there is no answer, or there is an answer no longer than $5\cdot10^5$ digits.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line contains a single integer $a$ ($2 \le a \le 10^3$).</p>

## Output

<p>If there is no such number $n$, print $-1$.</p><p>Otherwise print any appropriate positive integer $n$. Your number must not consist of more than $5\cdot10^5$ digits. We can show that under given constraints either there is no answer, or there is an answer no longer than $5\cdot10^5$ digits.</p>
