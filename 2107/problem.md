## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ $(1 \le n \le 1000)$, the size of the compressed sequence.</p><p>The second line contains a sequence of integers $c_1, c_2, \dots, c_n$ $(1 \le c_i \le 10^9)$, the compressed sequence.</p>

## Output

<p>Output a single integer&nbsp;— the total number of subsegments of the original bracket sequence, which are regular bracket sequences.</p><p>It can be proved that the answer fits in the signed 64-bit integer data type.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example a sequence <span class="tex-font-style-tt">(((()(()))(</span> is described. This bracket sequence contains $5$ subsegments which form regular bracket sequences:</p><ol> <li> Subsequence from the $3$rd to $10$th character: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">(()(()))</span> </li><li> Subsequence from the $4$th to $5$th character: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">()</span> </li><li> Subsequence from the $4$th to $9$th character: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">()(())</span> </li><li> Subsequence from the $6$th to $9$th character: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">(())</span> </li><li> Subsequence from the $7$th to $8$th character: <span class="tex-font-style-tt">()</span> </li></ol><p>In the second example a sequence <span class="tex-font-style-tt">()))(()(())))</span> is described.</p><p>In the third example a sequence <span class="tex-font-style-tt">()()(())</span> is described.</p>
