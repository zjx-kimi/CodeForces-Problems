## Note

<p>In the first example, the tree is as follows: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://LfFHwWdT.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the first query, no nodes are missing. The longest simple path starting from node $2$ is $2 \to 1 \to 3 \to 4$. Thus, the answer is $3$.</p><p>In the third query, nodes $1$ and $6$ are missing and the tree is shown below. The longest simple path starting from node $2$ is $2 \to 5$. Thus, the answer is $1$. </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://QWuGDX92.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
