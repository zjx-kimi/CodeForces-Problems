## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>Next $n - 1$ lines of each test cases describe the edges of the tree in form $a_i$, $b_i$ ($1 \le a_i, b_i \le n$, $a_i \neq b_i$).</p><p>It's guaranteed the given graph is a tree and the sum of $n$ in one test doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case in the first line print a single integer $k$&nbsp;— the minimum number of operations required to obtain a bamboo from the initial tree.</p><p>In the next $k$ lines print $4$ integers $x_1$, $y_1$, $x_2$, $y_2$ ($1 \le x_1, y_1, x_2, y_{2} \le n$, $x_1 \neq y_1$, $x_2 \neq y_2$)&nbsp;— this way you remove the edge $(x_1, y_1)$ and add an undirected edge $(x_2, y_2)$.</p><p>Note that the edge $(x_1, y_1)$ must be present in the graph at the moment of removing.</p>

## Note

<p>Note the graph can be <span class="tex-font-style-bf">unconnected</span> after a certain operation.</p><p>Consider the first test case of the example: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://bJEoxmmx.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center> The red edges are removed, and the green ones are added.
