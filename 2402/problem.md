## Description

<div><p>This week Arkady wanted to cook some pancakes (to follow ancient traditions) and make a problem about that. But then he remembered that one can't make a problem about stacking pancakes without working at a specific IT company, so he decided to bake the Napoleon cake instead.</p><p>To bake a Napoleon cake, one has to bake $n$ dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack, adding some cream. Arkady started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps $n$ times: </p><ul> <li> place a new cake layer on the top of the stack; </li><li> after the $i$-th layer is placed, pour $a_i$ units of cream on top of the stack. </li></ul><p>When $x$ units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, top $x$ layers of the cake get drenched in the cream. If there are less than $x$ layers, all layers get drenched and the rest of the cream is wasted. If $x = 0$, no layer gets drenched.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="76px" src="file://LrXl2wqm.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="567px"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">The picture represents the first test case of the example.</span> </center><p>Help Arkady determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over, and which don't.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 20\,000$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of layers in the cake.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the amount of cream poured on the cake after adding each layer.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single line with $n$ integers. The $i$-th of the integers should be equal to $1$ if the $i$-th layer from the bottom gets drenched, and $0$ otherwise.</p>
