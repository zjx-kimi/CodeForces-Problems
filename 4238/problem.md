## Description

<div><p>You are given a tree (a connected undirected graph without cycles) of $n$ vertices. Each of the $n - 1$ edges of the tree is colored in either black or red.</p><p>You are also given an integer $k$. Consider sequences of $k$ vertices. Let's call a sequence $[a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_k]$ <span class="tex-font-style-it">good</span> if it satisfies the following criterion:</p><ul> <li> We will walk a path (possibly visiting same edge/vertex multiple times) on the tree, starting from $a_1$ and ending at $a_k$. </li><li> Start at $a_1$, then go to $a_2$ using the shortest path between $a_1$ and $a_2$, then go to $a_3$ in a similar way, and so on, until you travel the shortest path between $a_{k-1}$ and $a_k$.</li><li> If you walked over at least one black edge during this process, then the sequence is good. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://UQ70BD0a.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Consider the tree on the picture. If $k=3$ then the following sequences are good: $[1, 4, 7]$, $[5, 5, 3]$ and $[2, 3, 7]$. The following sequences are not good: $[1, 4, 6]$, $[5, 5, 5]$, $[3, 7, 3]$.</p><p>There are $n^k$ sequences of vertices, count how many of them are good. Since this number can be quite large, print it modulo $10^9+7$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le k \le 100$), the size of the tree and the length of the vertex sequence.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$), where $u_i$ and $v_i$ denote the endpoints of the corresponding edge and $x_i$ is the color of this edge ($0$ denotes red edge and $1$ denotes black edge).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the number of good sequences modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$, $2 \le k \le 100$), the size of the tree and the length of the vertex sequence.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$ and $x_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $x_i \in \{0, 1\}$), where $u_i$ and $v_i$ denote the endpoints of the corresponding edge and $x_i$ is the color of this edge ($0$ denotes red edge and $1$ denotes black edge).</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, all sequences ($4^4$) of length $4$ <span class="tex-font-style-bf">except</span> the following are good: </p><ul> <li> $[1, 1, 1, 1]$</li><li> $[2, 2, 2, 2]$</li><li> $[3, 3, 3, 3]$</li><li> $[4, 4, 4, 4]$ </li></ul><p>In the second example, all edges are red, hence there aren't any good sequences.</p>
