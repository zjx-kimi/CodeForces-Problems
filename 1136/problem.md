## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 200$; $1 \le k \le n$). It is guaranteed that $n$ is divisible by $k$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains a string of $n$ lowercase Latin letters from <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span> to <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'y'</span> inclusively.

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a string of $k$ letters which is the most optimal string that Ela can find.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, the books can be divided into $3$ compartments as below:</p><ul> <li> the first compartment contains the books with indices $1, 2, 3, 7$: $multiset_1 = \{$<span class="tex-font-style-tt">'c'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'b'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'d'</span>$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $MEX(multiset_1) =$ <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'e'</span> </li><li> the second compartment contains the books with indices $4, 5, 6, 9$ : $multiset_2 = \{$<span class="tex-font-style-tt">'c'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'c'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'b'</span>$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $MEX(multiset_2) =$ <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'d'</span> </li><li> the third compartment contains the remaining books $8, 10, 11, 12$ : $multiset_3 = \{$ <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'a'</span>, <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'c'</span>$\}$ $\rightarrow$ $MEX(multiset_3) =$ <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'b'</span> </li></ul><p>Therefore, the answer is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'edb'</span>. It can be proven that there is no way that Ela can arrange the books so that it results in a lexicographically greater string.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://zzPbExZc.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
