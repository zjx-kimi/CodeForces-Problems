## Description

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1\le t\le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains three integers $n$, $m$, and $q$ ($2\le n\le 10^5$, $1\le m, q\le 2\cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices, edges, and queries respectively.</p><p>Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1\le u_i, v_i\le n$)&nbsp;— ends of the $i$-th edge.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the graph is connected and there are no multiple edges or self-loops.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $l$ and $r$ ($1\le l\le r\le n$)&nbsp;— descriptions of the queries.</p><p>It is guaranteed that that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $10^5$, the sum of $m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$, and the sum of $q$ over all test cases does not exceed $2\cdot 10^5$.</p>
