## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10\,000$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $e$ $(1 \le e \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$, the number of items in the array and number $e$, respectively.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ $(1 \le a_i \le 10^6)$, the contents of the array.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case output the answer in the following format:</p><p>Output one line containing the number of pairs of numbers $(i, k)$ which satisfy the conditions.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example test case two pairs satisfy the conditions: </p><ol> <li> $i = 2, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{2} \cdot a_{5} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 3, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{3} \cdot a_{6} = 19$ which is a prime number. </li></ol><p>In the second example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.</p><p>In the third example test case four pairs satisfy the conditions: </p><ol> <li> $i = 1, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{1} \cdot a_{4} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 1, k = 2$, for which the product is: $a_{1} \cdot a_{4} \cdot a_{7} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 3, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{3} \cdot a_{6} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 6, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{6} \cdot a_{9} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li></ol><p>In the fourth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.</p><p>In the fifth example test case five pairs satisfy the conditions: </p><ol> <li> $i = 1, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{1} \cdot a_{2} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 1, k = 2$, for which the product is: $a_{1} \cdot a_{2} \cdot a_{3} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 1, k = 3$, for which the product is: $a_{1} \cdot a_{2} \cdot a_{3} \cdot a_{4} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 2, k = 1$, for which the product is: $a_{2} \cdot a_{3} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li><li> $i = 2, k = 2$, for which the product is: $a_{2} \cdot a_{3} \cdot a_{4} = 2$ which is a prime number. </li></ol><p>In the sixth example test case there are no pairs that satisfy the conditions.</p>
