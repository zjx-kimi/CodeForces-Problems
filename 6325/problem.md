## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1  ≤  <i>n</i>  ≤  10<sup class="upper-index">5</sup></span>)&nbsp;— the number of pairs of guests.</p><p>The <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th of the next <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines contains a pair of integers <span class="tex-span"><i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub></span> (<span class="tex-span">1  ≤ <i>a</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub>, <i>b</i><sub class="lower-index"><i>i</i></sub> ≤  2<i>n</i></span>)&nbsp;— the number of chair on which the boy in the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th pair was sitting and the number of chair on which his girlfriend was sitting.

## Output

<p>If there is no solution, print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>.</p><p>Otherwise print <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines, the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th of them should contain two integers which represent the type of food for the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th pair. The first integer in the line is the type of food the boy had, and the second integer is the type of food the girl had. If someone had Kooft, print <span class="tex-span">1</span>, otherwise print <span class="tex-span">2</span>.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</p>
