## Description

<div><p>As a teacher, Riko Hakozaki often needs to help her students with problems from various subjects. Today, she is asked a programming task which goes as follows.</p><p>You are given an undirected complete graph with $n$ nodes, where some edges are pre-assigned with a positive weight while the rest aren't. You need to assign all unassigned edges with <span class="tex-font-style-bf">non-negative weights</span> so that in the resulting fully-assigned complete graph the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR">XOR</a> sum of all weights would be equal to $0$.</p><p>Define the <span class="tex-font-style-it">ugliness</span> of a fully-assigned complete graph the weight of its <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree">minimum spanning tree</a>, where the weight of a spanning tree equals the sum of weights of its edges. You need to assign the weights so that the ugliness of the resulting graph is as small as possible.</p><p>As a reminder, an undirected complete graph with $n$ nodes contains all edges $(u, v)$ with $1 \le u &lt; v \le n$; such a graph has $\frac{n(n-1)}{2}$ edges.</p><p>She is not sure how to solve this problem, so she asks you to solve it for her.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 1)$) &nbsp;— the number of nodes and the number of pre-assigned edges. The inputs are given so that there is at least one unassigned edge.</p><p>The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$, and $w_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u \ne v$, $1 \le w_i &lt; 2^{30}$), representing the edge from $u_i$ to $v_i$ has been pre-assigned with the weight $w_i$. No edge appears in the input more than once.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print on one line one integer &nbsp;— the minimum ugliness among all weight assignments with XOR sum equal to $0$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le \min(2 \cdot 10^5, \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - 1)$) &nbsp;— the number of nodes and the number of pre-assigned edges. The inputs are given so that there is at least one unassigned edge.</p><p>The $i$-th of the following $m$ lines contains three integers $u_i$, $v_i$, and $w_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$, $u \ne v$, $1 \le w_i &lt; 2^{30}$), representing the edge from $u_i$ to $v_i$ has been pre-assigned with the weight $w_i$. No edge appears in the input more than once.</p>

## Output

<p>Print on one line one integer &nbsp;— the minimum ugliness among all weight assignments with XOR sum equal to $0$.</p>

## Note

<p>The following image showcases the first test case. The black weights are pre-assigned from the statement, the red weights are assigned by us, and the minimum spanning tree is denoted by the blue edges.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://aRTk3PnM.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center>
