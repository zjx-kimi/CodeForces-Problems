The streets of the Winter Festival can be represented as a $n \times n$ undirected grid graph. Formally, the set of vertices is $\{(i,j) \; | \; 1 \leq i,j\leq n \}$ and two vertices $(i_1,j_1)$ and $(i_2,j_2)$ are connected by an edge if and only if $|i_1-i_2|+|j_1-j_2|=1$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://VUlSSpqq.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="227px"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">A network with size $n = 3$.</span> </center><p>Koxia and Mahiru are planning to visit The Winter Festival by traversing $2n$ routes. Although routes are not planned yet, the endpoints of the routes are already planned as follows:</p><ul> <li> In the $i$-th route, they want to start from vertex $(1, i)$ and end at vertex $(n, p_i)$, where $p$ is a permutation of length $n$. </li><li> In the $(i+n)$-th route, they want to start from vertex $(i, 1)$ and end at vertex $(q_i, n)$, where $q$ is a permutation of length $n$. </li></ul><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://EtVEf4QE.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="265px"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">A network with size $n = 3$, points to be connected are shown in the same color for $p = [3, 2, 1]$ and $q = [3, 1, 2]$.</span> </center><p>Your task is to find a routing scheme — $2n$ paths where each path connects the specified endpoints.

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200$) — the size of the network. </p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n$ ($1 \leq p_i \leq n$).</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n$ ($1 \leq q_i \leq n$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that both $p$ and $q$ are permutations of length $n$.</p>

## Output

<p>Output $2n$ lines, each line describing a route.</p><p>The first $n$ lines should describe the connections from top to bottom. The $i$-th line should describe the route starting at vertex $(1, i)$ and ending at vertex $(n, p_i)$.</p><p>The next $n$ lines should describe the connections from left to right. The $(i+n)$-th line should describe the route starting at vertex $(i, 1)$ and ending at vertex $(q_i, n)$.</p><p>Each line describing a route should start with an integer $k$ ($2 \le k \le 10^5$) — the number of vertices the route passes, including the starting and ending vertices.
