## Description

<div><p>You have an integer $n$. Let's define following tree generation as <span class="tex-font-style-it">McDic's generation</span>:</p><ol> <li> Make a complete and full binary tree of $2^{n} - 1$ vertices. Complete and full binary tree means a tree that exactly one vertex is a root, all leaves have the same depth (distance from the root), and all non-leaf nodes have exactly two child nodes. </li><li> Select a non-root vertex $v$ from that binary tree. </li><li> Remove $v$ from tree and make new edges between $v$'s parent and $v$'s direct children. If $v$ has no children, then no new edges will be made. </li></ol><p>You have a tree. Determine if this tree can be made by McDic's generation. If yes, then find the parent vertex of removed vertex in tree.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 17$).</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $2^{n} - 3$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \le a_{i} \lt b_{i} \le 2^{n} - 2$)&nbsp;— meaning there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print two lines.</p><p>In the first line, print a single integer&nbsp;— the number of answers. If given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then print $0$.</p><p>In the second line, print all possible answers in ascending order, separated by spaces. If the given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then don't print anything.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 17$).</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $2^{n} - 3$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ ($1 \le a_{i} \lt b_{i} \le 2^{n} - 2$)&nbsp;— meaning there is an edge between $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$. It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p>

## Output

<p>Print two lines.</p><p>In the first line, print a single integer&nbsp;— the number of answers. If given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then print $0$.</p><p>In the second line, print all possible answers in ascending order, separated by spaces. If the given tree cannot be made by McDic's generation, then don't print anything.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, $3$ is the only possible answer.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ZzLdqNKQ.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second example, there are $2$ possible answers.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://K5yrgeK5.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the third example, the tree can't be generated by McDic's generation.</p>
