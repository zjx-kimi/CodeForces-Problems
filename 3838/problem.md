## Input

<p>The only line of input contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \le n \le 10^{6}$, $1 \le k \le n-2$), the maximum number of sides of a polygon and the number of polygons to construct, respectively.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer — the minimum number of points required for $k$ polygons.</p>





```input1
6 2
```




```input2
200 50
```




```output1
6
```




```output2
708
```



## Note

<p>In the first example, we have $n = 6$ and $k = 2$. So, we have $4$ polygons with number of sides $3$, $4$, $5$ and $6$ to choose from and if we choose the triangle and the hexagon, then we can arrange them as shown in the picture in the statement.</p><p>Hence, the minimum number of points required on the circle is $6$, which is also the minimum overall possible sets.</p>
