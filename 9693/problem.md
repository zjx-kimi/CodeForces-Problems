## Description

<div><p>You are given a rectangular board of <span class="tex-span"><i>M</i> × <i>N</i></span> squares. Also you are given an unlimited number of standard domino pieces of <span class="tex-span">2 × 1</span> squares. You are allowed to rotate the pieces. You are asked to place as many dominoes as possible on the board so as to meet the following conditions:</p><p>1. Each domino completely covers two squares.</p><p>2. No two dominoes overlap.</p><p>3. Each domino lies entirely inside the board. It is allowed to touch the edges of the board.</p><p>Find the maximum number of dominoes, which can be placed under these restrictions.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>In a single line you are given two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>M</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> — board sizes in squares (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>M</i> ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 16</span>).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.</p></div>

## Input

<p>In a single line you are given two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>M</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>N</i></span> — board sizes in squares (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>M</i> ≤ <i>N</i> ≤ 16</span>).</p>

## Output

<p>Output one number — the maximal number of dominoes, which can be placed.</p>
