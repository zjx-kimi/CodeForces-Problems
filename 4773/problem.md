## Description

<div><p>You are given $n$ segments on a Cartesian plane. Each segment's endpoints have integer coordinates. Segments can intersect with each other. No two segments lie on the same line.</p><p>Count the number of distinct points with <span class="tex-font-style-bf">integer coordinates</span>, which are covered by at least one segment.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of segments.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains four integers $Ax_i, Ay_i, Bx_i, By_i$ ($-10^6 \le Ax_i, Ay_i, Bx_i, By_i \le 10^6$) — the coordinates of the endpoints $A$, $B$ ($A \ne B$) of the $i$-th segment.</p><p>It is guaranteed that no two segments lie on the same line.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer — the number of distinct points with integer coordinates, which are covered by at least one segment.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of segments.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains four integers $Ax_i, Ay_i, Bx_i, By_i$ ($-10^6 \le Ax_i, Ay_i, Bx_i, By_i \le 10^6$) — the coordinates of the endpoints $A$, $B$ ($A \ne B$) of the $i$-th segment.</p><p>It is guaranteed that no two segments lie on the same line.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer — the number of distinct points with integer coordinates, which are covered by at least one segment.</p>
