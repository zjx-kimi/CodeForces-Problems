The marmots need to get to work, and they could use a good plan...</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Same as the medium version, but the limits have changed: <span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>k</i> ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 500 000</span>.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Same as the medium version.</p></div>
