## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ robots driving along an OX axis. There are also two walls: one is at coordinate $0$ and one is at coordinate $m$.</p><p>The $i$-th robot starts at an integer coordinate $x_i~(0 &lt; x_i &lt; m)$ and moves either left (towards the $0$) or right with the speed of $1$ unit per second. No two robots start at the same coordinate.</p><p>Whenever a robot reaches a wall, it turns around instantly and continues his ride in the opposite direction with the same speed.</p><p>Whenever several robots meet at the same <span class="tex-font-style-bf">integer</span> coordinate, they collide and explode into dust. Once a robot has exploded, it doesn't collide with any other robot. Note that if several robots meet at a non-integer coordinate, nothing happens.</p><p>For each robot find out if it ever explodes and print the time of explosion if it happens and $-1$ otherwise.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of testcases.</p><p>Then the descriptions of $t$ testcases follow.</p><p>The first line of each testcase contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$; $2 \le m \le 10^8$)&nbsp;— the number of robots and the coordinate of the right wall.</p><p>The second line of each testcase contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($0 &lt; x_i &lt; m$)&nbsp;— the starting coordinates of the robots.</p><p>The third line of each testcase contains $n$ space-separated characters '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>'&nbsp;— the starting directions of the robots ('<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' stands for left and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>' stands for right).</p><p>All coordinates $x_i$ in the testcase are distinct.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each testcase print $n$ integers&nbsp;— for the $i$-th robot output the time it explodes at if it does and $-1$ otherwise.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of testcases.</p><p>Then the descriptions of $t$ testcases follow.</p><p>The first line of each testcase contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5$; $2 \le m \le 10^8$)&nbsp;— the number of robots and the coordinate of the right wall.</p><p>The second line of each testcase contains $n$ integers $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$ ($0 &lt; x_i &lt; m$)&nbsp;— the starting coordinates of the robots.</p><p>The third line of each testcase contains $n$ space-separated characters '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' or '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>'&nbsp;— the starting directions of the robots ('<span class="tex-font-style-tt">L</span>' stands for left and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">R</span>' stands for right).</p><p>All coordinates $x_i$ in the testcase are distinct.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $3 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each testcase print $n$ integers&nbsp;— for the $i$-th robot output the time it explodes at if it does and $-1$ otherwise.</p>

<p>Here is the picture for the seconds $0, 1, 2$ and $3$ of the first testcase: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://RHg0OwP3.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Notice that robots $2$ and $3$ don't collide because they meet at the same point $2.5$, which is not integer.</p><p>After second $3$ robot $6$ just drive infinitely because there's no robot to collide with.</p>
