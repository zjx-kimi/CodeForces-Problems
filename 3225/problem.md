## Description

<div><p>Ichihime is the current priestess of the Mahjong Soul Temple. She claims to be human, despite her cat ears.</p><p>These days the temple is holding a math contest. Usually, Ichihime lacks interest in these things, but this time the prize for the winner is her favorite — cookies. Ichihime decides to attend the contest.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$) &nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The next $t$ lines describe test cases. Each test case is given as four space-separated integers $a$, $b$, $c$, $d$ ($1 \leq a \leq b \leq c \leq d \leq 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ &nbsp;— the integers you found satisfying the conditions given in the statement.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the answer always exists. If there are multiple answers, print any.</p>
