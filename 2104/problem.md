Each team is characterized by strength $a_i$. Each two teams $i &lt; j$ play with each other exactly once. Team $i$ wins with probability $\frac{a_i}{a_i + a_j}$ and team $j$ wins with probability $\frac{a_j}{a_i + a_j}$.</p><p>The team is called a winner if it directly or indirectly defeated all other teams. Team $a$ defeated (directly or indirectly) team $b$ if there is a sequence of teams $c_1$, $c_2$, ... $c_k$ such that $c_1 = a$, $c_k = b$ and team $c_i$ defeated team $c_{i + 1}$ for all $i$ from $1$ to $k - 1$. Note that it is possible that team $a$ defeated team $b$ and in the same time team $b$ defeated team $a$.</p><p>William wants you to find the expected value of the number of winners.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 14$), which is the total number of teams participating in a match.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$) &nbsp;— the strengths of teams participating in a match.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output a single integer &nbsp;— the expected value of the number of winners of the tournament modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p><p>Formally, let $M = 10^9+7$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 14$), which is the total number of teams participating in a match.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6$) &nbsp;— the strengths of teams participating in a match.</p>

## Output

<p>Output a single integer &nbsp;— the expected value of the number of winners of the tournament modulo $10^9 + 7$.</p><p>Formally, let $M = 10^9+7$. It can be demonstrated that the answer can be presented as a irreducible fraction $\frac{p}{q}$, where $p$ and $q$ are integers and $q \not \equiv 0 \pmod{M}$. Output a single integer equal to $p \cdot q^{-1} \bmod M$. In other words, output an integer $x$ such that $0 \le x &lt; M$ and $x \cdot q \equiv p \pmod{M}$.</p>

## Note

<p>To better understand in which situation several winners are possible let's examine the second test:</p><p>One possible result of the tournament is as follows ($a \rightarrow b$ means that $a$ defeated $b$):</p><ul> <li> $1 \rightarrow 2$ </li><li> $2 \rightarrow 3$ </li><li> $3 \rightarrow 1$ </li><li> $1 \rightarrow 4$ </li><li> $1 \rightarrow 5$ </li><li> $2 \rightarrow 4$ </li><li> $2 \rightarrow 5$ </li><li> $3 \rightarrow 4$ </li><li> $3 \rightarrow 5$ </li><li> $4 \rightarrow 5$ </li></ul><p>Or more clearly in the picture:</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" height="302px" src="file://wTF3He39.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;" width="302px"> </center><p>In this case every team from the set $\{ 1, 2, 3 \}$ directly or indirectly defeated everyone. I.e.:</p><ul> <li> $1$st defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way $1 \rightarrow 2$, $1 \rightarrow 2 \rightarrow 3$, $1 \rightarrow 4$, $1 \rightarrow 5$. </li><li> $2$nd defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way $2 \rightarrow 3$, $2 \rightarrow 3 \rightarrow 1$, $2 \rightarrow 4$, $2 \rightarrow 5$. </li><li> $3$rd defeated everyone because they can get to everyone else in the following way $3 \rightarrow 1$, $3 \rightarrow 1 \rightarrow 2$, $3 \rightarrow 4$, $3 \rightarrow 5$. </li></ul><p>Therefore the total number of winners is $3$.</p>
