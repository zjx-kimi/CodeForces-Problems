## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 5\cdot 10^4$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $p$ ($1 \le p \le 17$), where $n$ (the number of vertices in the tree) is equal to $2^p$.</p><p>Each of the next $n−1$ lines contains two integers $u$ and $v$ ($1 \le u,v \le n$) meaning that there is an edge between the vertices $u$ and $v$ in the tree.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given graph is a tree.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $3\cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case on the first line print the chosen root.</p><p>On the second line, print $n$ integers separated by spaces, where the $i$-th integer represents the chosen value for the $i$-th node.</p><p>On the third line, print $n-1$ integers separated by spaces, where the $i$-th integer represents the chosen value for the $i$-th edge. The edges are numerated in the order of their appearance in the input data.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, you may output any.</p>
