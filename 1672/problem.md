## Description

<div><p>There is a sheet of paper that can be represented with a grid of size $n \times m$: $n$ rows and $m$ columns of cells. All cells are colored in white initially.</p><p>$q$ operations have been applied to the sheet. The $i$-th of them can be described as follows: </p><ul> <li> $x_i$ $y_i$&nbsp;— choose one of $k$ non-white colors and color the entire row $x_i$ and the entire column $y_i$ in it. The new color is applied to each cell, regardless of whether the cell was colored before the operation. </li></ul><p>The sheet after applying all $q$ operations is called a coloring. Two colorings are different if there exists at least one cell that is colored in different colors.</p><p>How many different colorings are there? Print the number modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of testcases.</p><p>The first line of the testcase contains four integers $n, m, k$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, m, k, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the size of the sheet, the number of non-white colors and the number of operations.</p><p>The $i$-th of the following $q$ lines contains a description of the $i$-th operation&nbsp;— two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le n$; $1 \le y_i \le m$)&nbsp;— the row and the column the operation is applied to.</p><p>The sum of $q$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each testcase, print a single integer&nbsp;— the number of different colorings modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of testcases.</p><p>The first line of the testcase contains four integers $n, m, k$ and $q$ ($1 \le n, m, k, q \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the size of the sheet, the number of non-white colors and the number of operations.</p><p>The $i$-th of the following $q$ lines contains a description of the $i$-th operation&nbsp;— two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ ($1 \le x_i \le n$; $1 \le y_i \le m$)&nbsp;— the row and the column the operation is applied to.</p><p>The sum of $q$ over all testcases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each testcase, print a single integer&nbsp;— the number of different colorings modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p>
