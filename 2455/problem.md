## Description

<div><p>After realizing that Zookeeper is just a duck, the animals have overthrown Zookeeper. They now have to decide a new ruler among themselves through a fighting tournament of the following format:</p><p>Initially, animal $0$ is king, while everyone else queues up with animal $1$ at the front of the queue and animal $n-1$ at the back. The animal at the front of the queue will challenge the king to a fight, and the animal with greater strength will win the fight. The winner will become king, while the loser joins the back of the queue.</p><p>An animal who <span class="tex-font-style-bf">wins $3$ times consecutively</span> will be crowned ruler for the whole zoo. The strength of each animal depends on how many consecutive fights he won. Animal $i$ has strength $A_i$ with $0$ consecutive win, $B_i$ with $1$ consecutive win, and $C_i$ with $2$ consecutive wins. Initially, everyone has $0$ consecutive win.</p><p><span class="tex-font-style-bf">For all animals, $A_i &gt; B_i$ and $C_i &gt; B_i$</span>. Also, the values of $A_i$, $B_i$, $C_i$ are <span class="tex-font-style-bf">distinct</span> (all $3n$ values are pairwise different). </p><p>In other words, an animal who is not a king has strength $A_i$. A king usually has a strength of $B_i$ or $C_i$. The exception is on the first turn, the first king (animal $0$) has strength $A_i$.</p><p>Who is the new ruler, and after how many fights? Or will it end up that animals fight forever with no one ending up as ruler?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 6000$) — number of the animals. </p><p>$i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains $3$ integers $A_i$, $B_i$ and $C_i$ ($0 \leq A_i, B_i, C_i \leq 10^9$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that $A_i &gt; B_i$ and $C_i &gt; B_i$, and that all values of $A_i$, $B_i$ and $C_i$ are distinct.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output two integers in a single line. The first is the index of the animal that will become ruler, and the second is the number of fights passed until some animal becomes the ruler.</p><p>If the animals will fight for infinitely long, output <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1 -1</span> instead.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($4 \leq n \leq 6000$) — number of the animals. </p><p>$i$-th of the next $n$ lines contains $3$ integers $A_i$, $B_i$ and $C_i$ ($0 \leq A_i, B_i, C_i \leq 10^9$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that $A_i &gt; B_i$ and $C_i &gt; B_i$, and that all values of $A_i$, $B_i$ and $C_i$ are distinct.</p>

## Output

<p>Output two integers in a single line. The first is the index of the animal that will become ruler, and the second is the number of fights passed until some animal becomes the ruler.</p><p>If the animals will fight for infinitely long, output <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1 -1</span> instead.</p>

## Note

<p>The following describes the sequence of events for the second sample. Note that in fight $1$, the king (animal $0$) has strength $A_0$. The tournament ends at fight $7$ as animal $1$ wins fight $5$, $6$ and $7$. <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://vRXzfMjP.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p>
