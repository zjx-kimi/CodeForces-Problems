## Description

<div><p>Your task is the exact same as for the <span class="tex-font-style-it">easy</span> version. But this time, the marmots subtract the village's population <span class="tex-span"><i>P</i></span> from their random number before responding to Heidi's request.</p><p>Also, there are now villages with as few as a single inhabitant, meaning that <img align="middle" class="tex-formula" src="file://YJdYj0Uh.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">.</p><p>Can you help Heidi find out whether a village follows a Poisson or a uniform distribution?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Same as for the easy and medium versions. But remember that now <span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>P</i> ≤ 1000</span> and that the marmots may provide positive as well as negative integers.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's line shall state <span class="tex-font-style-it">poisson</span> if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type, and <span class="tex-font-style-it">uniform</span> if the answers came from a uniform distribution.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Same as for the easy and medium versions. But remember that now <span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>P</i> ≤ 1000</span> and that the marmots may provide positive as well as negative integers.</p>

## Output

<p>Output one line per village, in the same order as provided in the input. The village's line shall state <span class="tex-font-style-it">poisson</span> if the village's distribution is of the Poisson type, and <span class="tex-font-style-it">uniform</span> if the answers came from a uniform distribution.</p>
