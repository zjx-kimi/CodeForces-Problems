## Description

<div><div class="epigraph"><div class="epigraph-text">As for the technology in the outside world, it is really too advanced for Gensokyo to even look up to.</div><div class="epigraph-source">—Yasaka Kanako, <span class="tex-font-style-it">Symposium of Post-mysticism</span></div></div><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">This is an interactive problem</span>.</p><p>Under the direct supervision of Kanako and the Moriya Shrine, the railway system of Gensokyo is finally finished. GSKR (Gensokyo Railways) consists of $n$ stations with $m$ bidirectional tracks connecting them. The $i$-th track has length $l_i$ ($1\le l_i\le 10^6$). Due to budget limits, the railway system <span class="tex-font-style-bf">may not be connected</span>, though there may be more than one track between two stations.</p><p>The <span class="tex-font-style-it">value</span> of a railway system is defined as the total length of its all tracks. The <span class="tex-font-style-it">maximum (or minimum) capacity</span> of a railway system is defined as the maximum (or minimum) value among all of the currently functional system's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spanning_tree#Spanning_forests">full spanning forest</a>.</p><p>In brief, full spanning forest of a graph is a spanning forest with the same connectivity as the given graph.</p><p>Kanako has a simulator only able to process no more than $2m$ queries. The input of the simulator is a string $s$ of length $m$, consisting of characters <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> and/or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>. The simulator will assume the $i$-th track functional if $s_i=$ <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>. The device will then tell Kanako the maximum capacity of the system in the simulated state.</p><p>Kanako wants to know the the minimum capacity of the system with all tracks functional with the help of the simulator.</p><p>The structure of the railway system is fixed in advance. In other words, the interactor is not adaptive.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first and only line of input contains two integers $n,m$ ($2 \leq n \leq 200$, $1\le m \le 500$) — the number of stations and tracks.</p></div><div><h2>Interaction</h2><p>Begin the interaction by reading $n,m$.</p><p>To make a query, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">?</span> $s$" (without quotes, $s$ is a string of length $m$, consisting of characters <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> and/or <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>).

## Input
