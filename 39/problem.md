## Description

<div><p>A square of positive (strictly greater than $0$) area is located on the coordinate plane, with sides parallel to the coordinate axes.

## Input

<p>Each test consists of several testcases. The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of testcases. The following is a description of the testcases.</p><p>Each testcase contains four lines, each line contains two integers $x_i, y_i$ ($-1000\le x_i, y_i\le 1000$), coordinates of the corners of the square. </p><p>It is guaranteed that there is a square with sides parallel to the coordinate axes, with positive (strictly greater than $0$) area, with corners in given points.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single integer, the area of the square.</p>
