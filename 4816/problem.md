## Description

<div><p>Vasya has got three integers $n$, $m$ and $k$. He'd like to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$, such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$.</p><p>Help Vasya! Find such points (if it's possible). If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>If there are no such points, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p><p>Otherwise print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</p><p>You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</p></div>

## Input

<p>The single line contains three integers $n$, $m$, $k$ ($1\le n, m \le 10^9$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>If there are no such points, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>".</p><p>Otherwise print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" in the first line. The next three lines should contain integers $x_i, y_i$ — coordinates of the points, one point per line. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.</p><p>You can print each letter in any case (upper or lower).</p>





```input1
4 3 3

```




```input2
4 4 7

```




```output1
YES
1 0
2 3
4 1

```




```output2
NO

```



## Note

<p>In the first example area of the triangle should be equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 4$. The triangle mentioned in the output is pictured below: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://p3LTajuw.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the second example there is no triangle with area $\frac{nm}{k} = \frac{16}{7}$.</p>
