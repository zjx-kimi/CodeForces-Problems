## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>m</i></span>, separated by a space — the size of the Domino Carpet (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i>, <i>m</i> ≤ 250</span>). Next <span class="tex-span">4<i>n</i> + 1</span> lines contain <span class="tex-span">4<i>m</i> + 1</span> symbols. </p><p>Each square of the Domino Carpet, which is a domino half, is described by a <span class="tex-span">3 × 3</span> square. Symbol <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'O'</span> in this square indicates the presence of a point, symbol <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'.'</span> — its absence. </p><p>Each <span class="tex-span">3 × 3</span> square is delineated from adjacent squares by symbols <span class="tex-font-style-tt">'#'</span> as shown in the examples. </p><p>It is guaranteed that every box describes the correct half of a domino. </p><p>In all pretests the Domino Carpets have the size of <span class="tex-span">2 × 2</span> and <span class="tex-span">4 × 4</span>.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single number, the number of ways to assemble the Domino Carpet modulo <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup> + 7</span>, using only standard dominoes of size <span class="tex-span">1 × 2</span>.</p>
