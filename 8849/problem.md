## Description

<div><p>You've got a rectangular parallelepiped with integer edge lengths. You know the areas of its three faces that have a common vertex. Your task is to find the sum of lengths of all 12 edges of this parallelepiped.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive <span class="tex-span">( &gt; 0)</span> and do not exceed <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">4</sup></span>. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first and the single line contains three space-separated integers — the areas of the parallelepiped's faces. The area's values are positive <span class="tex-span">( &gt; 0)</span> and do not exceed <span class="tex-span">10<sup class="upper-index">4</sup></span>. It is guaranteed that there exists at least one parallelepiped that satisfies the problem statement.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single number — the sum of all edges of the parallelepiped.</p>





```input1
1 1 1

```




```input2
4 6 6

```




```output1
12

```




```output2
28

```



## Note

<p>In the first sample the parallelepiped has sizes <span class="tex-span">1 × 1 × 1</span>, in the second one&nbsp;— <span class="tex-span">2 × 2 × 3</span>.</p>
