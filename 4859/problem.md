## Description

<div><p>In Summer Informatics School, if a student doesn't behave well, teachers make a hole in his badge. And today one of the teachers caught a group of $n$ students doing yet another trick. </p><p>Let's assume that all these students are numbered from $1$ to $n$. The teacher came to student $a$ and put a hole in his badge. The student, however, claimed that the main culprit is some other student $p_a$.</p><p>After that, the teacher came to student $p_a$ and made a hole in his badge as well. The student in reply said that the main culprit was student $p_{p_a}$.</p><p>This process went on for a while, but, since the number of students was finite, eventually the teacher came to the student, who already had a hole in his badge.</p><p>After that, the teacher put a second hole in the student's badge and decided that he is done with this process, and went to the sauna.</p><p>You don't know the first student who was caught by the teacher. However, you know all the numbers $p_i$. Your task is to find out for every student $a$, who would be the student with two holes in the badge if the first caught student was $a$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains the only integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of the naughty students.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1$, ..., $p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$), where $p_i$ indicates the student who was reported to the teacher by student $i$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For every student $a$ from $1$ to $n$ print which student would receive two holes in the badge, if $a$ was the first student caught by the teacher.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains the only integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of the naughty students.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $p_1$, ..., $p_n$ ($1 \le p_i \le n$), where $p_i$ indicates the student who was reported to the teacher by student $i$.</p>

## Output

<p>For every student $a$ from $1$ to $n$ print which student would receive two holes in the badge, if $a$ was the first student caught by the teacher.</p>

## Note

<p>The picture corresponds to the first example test case.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://AcvyAzma.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>When $a = 1$, the teacher comes to students $1$, $2$, $3$, $2$, in this order, and the student $2$ is the one who receives a second hole in his badge.</p><p>When $a = 2$, the teacher comes to students $2$, $3$, $2$, and the student $2$ gets a second hole in his badge. When $a = 3$, the teacher will visit students $3$, $2$, $3$ with student $3$ getting a second hole in his badge.</p><p>For the second example test case it's clear that no matter with whom the teacher starts, that student would be the one who gets the second hole in his badge.</p>
