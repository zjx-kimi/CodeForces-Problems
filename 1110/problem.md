## Description

<div><p>Given a rooted tree, define the value of vertex $u$ in the tree recursively as the MEX$^\dagger$ of the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">values of its children</span>. Note that it is only the children, not all of its descendants. In particular, the value of a leaf is $0$.</p><p>Pak Chanek has a rooted tree that initially only contains a single vertex with index $1$, which is the root. Pak Chanek is going to do $q$ queries. In the $i$-th query, Pak Chanek is given an integer $x_i$. Pak Chanek needs to add a new vertex with index $i+1$ as the child of vertex $x_i$. After adding the new vertex, Pak Chanek needs to recalculate the values of all vertices and report the sum of the values of all vertices in the current tree.</p><p>$^\dagger$ The MEX (minimum excluded) of an array is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the array. For example, the MEX of $[0,1,1,2,6,7]$ is $3$ and the MEX of $[6,9]$ is $0$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of operations.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains a single integer $x_i$ ($1 \leq x_i \leq i$) — the description of the $i$-th query.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each query, print a line containing an integer representing the sum of the new values of all vertices in the tree after adding the vertex.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of operations.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains a single integer $x_i$ ($1 \leq x_i \leq i$) — the description of the $i$-th query.</p>

## Output

<p>For each query, print a line containing an integer representing the sum of the new values of all vertices in the tree after adding the vertex.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, the tree after the $6$-th query will look like this.</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://YwsbHfq1.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><ul> <li> Vertex $7$ is a leaf, so its value is $0$. </li><li> Vertex $6$ is a leaf, so its value is $0$. </li><li> Vertex $5$ only has a child with value $0$, so its value is $1$. </li><li> Vertex $4$ is a leaf, so its value is $0$. </li><li> Vertex $3$ only has a child with value $0$, so its value is $1$. </li><li> Vertex $2$ has children with values $0$ and $1$, so its value is $2$. </li><li> Vertex $1$ has children with values $1$ and $2$, so its value is $0$. </li></ul><p>The sum of the values of all vertices is $0+0+1+0+1+2+0=4$.</p>
