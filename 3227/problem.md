The $i$-th doll has a non-negative integer value $a_i$ ($a_i &lt; 2^m$, $m$ is given).

The value of this picking way is equal to the number of $1$-bits in the binary representation of $x$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le m \le 53$) &nbsp;— the number of dolls and the maximum value of the picking way.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \le a_i &lt; 2^m$) &nbsp;— the values of dolls.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $m+1$ integers $p_0, p_1, \ldots, p_m$ &nbsp;— $p_i$ is equal to the number of picking ways with value $i$ by modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p>
