## Description

<div><p>Polycarp doesn't like integers that are divisible by $3$ or end with the digit $3$ in their decimal representation. Integers that meet both conditions are disliked by Polycarp, too.</p><p>Polycarp starts to write out the positive (greater than $0$) integers which he likes: $1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 14, 16, \dots$. Output the $k$-th element of this sequence (the elements are numbered from $1$).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 1000$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output in a separate line one integer $x$ — the $k$-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. Then $t$ test cases follow.</p><p>Each test case consists of one line containing one integer $k$ ($1 \le k \le 1000$).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output in a separate line one integer $x$ — the $k$-th element of the sequence that was written out by Polycarp.</p>
