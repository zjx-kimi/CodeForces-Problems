## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $k$ ($1 \leq k \leq 999999$): the number of numbers each sheep has to write. </p><p> The next line contains six integers $F_0$, $F_1$, $F_2$, $F_3$, $F_4$, $F_5$ ($1 \leq F_i \leq 10^9$): the fortune assigned to each digit. </p><p> The next line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \leq q \leq 100\,000$): the number of sheep.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains a single integer $n_i$ ($1 \leq n_i \leq 999999$): the sum of numbers that $i$-th sheep has to write.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $q$ lines, where the $i$-th line contains the maximum sum of fortune of all numbers of the $i$-th sheep.</p>

```



## Note

<p>In the first test case, $57 = 9 + 9 + 39$. The three $9$'s contribute $1 \cdot 3$ and $3$ at the tens position contributes $2 \cdot 1$. Hence the sum of fortune is $11$.</p><p>In the second test case, $63 = 35 + 19 + 9$. The sum of fortune is $8$.</p>
