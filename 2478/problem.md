## Description

<div><p>A bracket sequence is a string containing only characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">)</span>". A regular bracket sequence (or, shortly, an RBS) is a bracket sequence that can be transformed into a correct arithmetic expression by inserting characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">+</span>" between the original characters of the sequence. For example:</p><ul> <li> bracket sequences "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">()()</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(())</span>" are regular (the resulting expressions are: "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(1)+(1)</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">((1+1)+1)</span>"); </li><li> bracket sequences "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">)(</span>", "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(</span>" and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">)</span>" are not. </li></ul><p>You are given a string $s$, which is an RBS. You can apply any number of operations to this string. Each operation can have one of the following types:</p><ol> <li> choose some non-empty prefix of $s$ and remove it from $s$, so $s$ is still an RBS. For example, we can apply this operation as follows: "<span class="tex-font-style-tt"><span class="tex-font-style-bf">(())()(())</span>()()</span>" $\to$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">()()</span>" (the first $10$ characters are removed); </li><li> choose some <span class="tex-font-style-bf">contiguous</span> non-empty substring of $s$ and remove it from $s$, so $s$ is still an RBS. For example, we can apply this operation as follows: "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(())()<span class="tex-font-style-bf">(())</span>()()</span>" $\to$ "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(())()()()</span>" (the characters from the $7$-th to the $10$-th are removed). </li></ol><p>The operation $2$ can be applied at most $k$ times. Calculate the maximum number of operations you can apply until $s$ becomes empty.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case is described by two lines. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k \le n$; $n$ is even) — the length of $s$ and the maximum number of operations of type $2$ you can apply.</p><p>The second line contains a string $s$ of $n$ characters '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(</span>' and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">)</span>'. This string is an RBS.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of operations you can apply.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^5$) — the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case is described by two lines. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k \le n$; $n$ is even) — the length of $s$ and the maximum number of operations of type $2$ you can apply.</p><p>The second line contains a string $s$ of $n$ characters '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">(</span>' and '<span class="tex-font-style-tt">)</span>'. This string is an RBS.</p><p>The sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print one integer — the maximum number of operations you can apply.</p>
