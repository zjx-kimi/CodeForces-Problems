## Description

<div><p>You are given an undirected tree, consisting of $n$ vertices.</p><p>The vertex is called a leaf if it has exactly one vertex adjacent to it.</p><p>The distance between some pair of vertices is the number of edges in the shortest path between them.</p><p>Let's call some set of leaves <span class="tex-font-style-it">beautiful</span> if the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in it is less or equal to $k$.</p><p>You want to split <span class="tex-font-style-bf">all</span> leaves into <span class="tex-font-style-bf">non-intersecting</span> beautiful sets. What is the minimal number of sets in such a split?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \le n \le 10^6$, $1 \le k \le 10^6$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in each beautiful set.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$) — the description of the $i$-th edge. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single integer — the minimal number of beautiful sets the split can have. </p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($3 \le n \le 10^6$, $1 \le k \le 10^6$) — the number of vertices in the tree and the maximum distance between any pair of leaves in each beautiful set.</p><p>Each of the next $n - 1$ lines contains two integers $v_i$ and $u_i$ ($1 \le v_i, u_i \le n$) — the description of the $i$-th edge. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer — the minimal number of beautiful sets the split can have. </p>
