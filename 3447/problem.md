## Description

<div><p>An infinitely long Line Chillland Collider (LCC) was built in Chillland. There are $n$ pipes with coordinates $x_i$ that are connected to LCC. When the experiment starts at time 0, $i$-th proton flies from the $i$-th pipe with speed $v_i$. It flies to the right with probability $p_i$ and flies to the left with probability $(1 - p_i)$. The <span class="tex-font-style-it">duration of the experiment</span> is determined as the time of the first collision of any two protons. In case there is no collision, the duration of the experiment is considered to be zero.</p><p>Find the expected value of the duration of the experiment.</p><center><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://KF5p1TO5.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;">Illustration for the first example</center></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of input contains one integer $n$&nbsp;— the number of pipes ($1 \le n \le 10^5$).

## Input

<p>The first line of input contains one integer $n$&nbsp;— the number of pipes ($1 \le n \le 10^5$). Each of the following $n$ lines contains three integers $x_i$, $v_i$, $p_i$&nbsp;— the coordinate of the $i$-th pipe, the speed of the $i$-th proton and the probability that the $i$-th proton flies to the right in percentage points ($-10^9 \le x_i \le 10^9, 1 \le v \le 10^6, 0 \le p_i \le 100$). It is guaranteed that all $x_i$ are distinct and sorted in increasing order.</p>

## Output

<p>It's possible to prove that the answer can always be represented as a fraction $P/Q$, where $P$ is an integer and $Q$ is a natural number not divisible by $998\,244\,353$. In this case, print $P \cdot Q^{-1}$ modulo $998\,244\,353$.</p>
