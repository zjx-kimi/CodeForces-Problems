## Description

<div><p>Pak Chanek plans to build a garage. He wants the garage to consist of a square and a right triangle that are arranged like the following illustration.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://lR75hMwE.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Define $a$ and $b$ as the lengths of two of the sides in the right triangle as shown in the illustration. An integer $x$ is suitable if and only if we can construct a garage with assigning <span class="tex-font-style-bf">positive integer</span> values for the lengths $a$ and $b$ ($a&lt;b$) so that the area of the square at the bottom is exactly $x$. As a good friend of Pak Chanek, you are asked to help him find the $N$-th smallest suitable number.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>An integer that represents the $N$-th smallest suitable number.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line contains a single integer $N$ ($1 \leq N \leq 10^9$).</p>

## Output

<p>An integer that represents the $N$-th smallest suitable number.</p>





```input1
3
```




```output1
7
```



## Note

<p>The $3$-rd smallest suitable number is $7$. A square area of $7$ can be obtained by assigning $a=3$ and $b=4$.</p>
