## Description

<div><p>To destroy humanity, The Monster Association sent $n$ monsters to Earth's surface. The $i$-th monster has health $h_i$ and power $p_i$.</p><p>With his last resort attack, True Spiral Incineration Cannon, Genos can deal $k$ damage to all monsters alive. In other words, Genos can reduce the health of all monsters by $k$ (if $k &gt; 0$) with a single attack. </p><p>However, after every attack Genos makes, the monsters advance. With their combined efforts, they reduce Genos' attack damage by the power of the $^\dagger$weakest monster $^\ddagger$alive. In other words, the minimum $p_i$ among all currently living monsters is subtracted from the value of $k$ after each attack.</p><p>$^\dagger$The Weakest monster is the one with the least power.</p><p>$^\ddagger$A monster is alive if its health is strictly greater than $0$.</p><p>Will Genos be successful in killing all the monsters?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers, $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 10^5$) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage.

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$) — the number of test cases. The description of test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers, $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n, k \le 10^5$) — the number of monsters and Genos' initial attack damage. Then two lines follow, each containing $n$ integers describing the arrays $h$ and $p$ ($1 \le h_i, p_i \le 10^9$).</p><p>It's guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print the answer — "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>" (without quotes) if Genos could kill all monsters and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">NO</span>" otherwise.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example, after Genos' first attack, $h$ and $k$ will update to: </p><ul> <li> $h: [11,0,6,2,3,0]$ </li><li> $k: 7-1 = 6$ </li></ul> After second attack: <ul> <li> $h: [5,0,0,0,0,0]$ </li><li> $k: 6-2 = 4$ </li></ul> After third attack: <ul> <li> $h: [1,0,0,0,0,0]$ </li><li> $k: 4-2 = 2$ </li></ul> After fourth attack: <ul> <li> $h: [0,0,0,0,0,0]$ </li></ul> As Genos could kill all monsters, the answer is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">YES</span>.
