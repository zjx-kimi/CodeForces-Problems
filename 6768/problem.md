When a man fixes a new critical bug one of the earlier awarded "I fixed a critical bug" pennants is passed on to his table. When a man suggests a new interesting feature one of the earlier awarded "I suggested a new feature" pennants is passed on to his table.</p><p>One man can have several pennants of one type and of course he can have pennants of both types on his table. There are <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> tables in the IT company. Find the number of ways to place the pennants on these tables given that each pennant is situated on one of the tables and each table is big enough to contain any number of pennants.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line of the input contains one integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">1 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 500</span>) — the number of tables in the IT company.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one integer — the amount of ways to place the pennants on <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> tables.</p></div>
