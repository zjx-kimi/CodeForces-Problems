Note that $\gcd(x, y)$ denotes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of integers $x$ and $y$ and a prime number is a positive integer which has exactly $2$ divisors.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) - the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 16$) - the number of prime factor of $c$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ ($1 \le b_i &lt; 2^{20}$) — exponents of corresponding prime factors of $c$, so that $c = p_1^{b_1} \cdot p_2^{b_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{b_m}$ and $n = (b_1 + 1)(b_2 + 1) \ldots (b_m + 1)$ hold. $p_i$ is the $i$-th smallest prime number.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{20}$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the answer for each test case, one per line.

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) - the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains one integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 16$) - the number of prime factor of $c$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $m$ integers $b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_m$ ($1 \le b_i &lt; 2^{20}$) — exponents of corresponding prime factors of $c$, so that $c = p_1^{b_1} \cdot p_2^{b_2} \cdot \ldots \cdot p_m^{b_m}$ and $n = (b_1 + 1)(b_2 + 1) \ldots (b_m + 1)$ hold. $p_i$ is the $i$-th smallest prime number.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n \cdot m$ over all test cases does not exceed $2^{20}$.</p>

## Output

<p>Print the answer for each test case, one per line. If there is no sequence for the given $c$, print $-1$.</p><p>Otherwise, print $n - 1$ lines. In $i$-th line, print $m$ space-separated integers. The $j$-th integer of $i$-th line is equal to the exponent of $j$-th prime number from $a_i$.</p><p>If there are multiple answers, print any of them.</p>

## Note

<p>In each test case, the values of $c$ are $6$, $2$, $30$, $16$, and $12$ in that order.</p><p>In the first test case, $1$, $2$, $3$, $6$ are divisors of $6$. Here, sequences $[2, 6, 3]$ and $[3, 6, 2]$ can be answer. Permutation $[3, 2, 6]$ is invalid because $\gcd(a_1, a_2) = 1$ is not a prime number.</p><p>In the forth test case, $1$, $2$, $4$, $8$, $16$ are divisors of $16$. Among the permutation of sequence $[2, 4, 8, 16]$, no valid answer exist.</p>
