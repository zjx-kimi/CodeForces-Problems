## Description

<div><p>Chanek Jones is back, helping his long-lost relative Indiana Jones, to find a secret treasure in a maze buried below a desert full of illusions.</p><p>The map of the labyrinth forms a tree with $n$ rooms numbered from $1$ to $n$ and $n - 1$ tunnels connecting them such that it is possible to travel between each pair of rooms through several tunnels.</p><p>The $i$-th room ($1 \leq i \leq n$) has $a_i$ illusion rate. To go from the $x$-th room to the $y$-th room, there must exist a tunnel between $x$ and $y$, and it takes $\max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)$ energy. $|z|$ denotes the absolute value of $z$.</p><p>To prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask $q$ queries.</p><p>There are two types of queries to be done:</p><ul> <li> $1\ u\ c$ — The illusion rate of the $x$-th room is changed to $c$ ($1 \leq u \leq n$, $0 \leq |c| \leq 10^9$). </li><li> $2\ u\ v$ — Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room $v$ if they are initially at room $u$ ($1 \leq u, v \leq n$). </li></ul><p>Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq q \leq 10^5$) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq |a_i| \leq 10^9$) — inital illusion rate of each room.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $s_i$ and $t_i$ ($1 \leq s_i, t_i \leq n$), meaning there is a tunnel connecting $s_i$-th room and $t_i$-th room. The given edges form a tree.</p><p>The next $q$ lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each type $2$ query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ ($2 \leq n \leq 10^5$, $1 \leq q \leq 10^5$) — the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($0 \leq |a_i| \leq 10^9$) — inital illusion rate of each room.</p><p>The $i$-th of the next $n-1$ lines contains two integers $s_i$ and $t_i$ ($1 \leq s_i, t_i \leq n$), meaning there is a tunnel connecting $s_i$-th room and $t_i$-th room. The given edges form a tree.</p><p>The next $q$ lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.</p>

## Output

<p>For each type $2$ query, output a line containing an integer — the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.</p>
