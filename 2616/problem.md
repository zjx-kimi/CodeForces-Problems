## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ cards numbered $1, \ldots, n$. The card $i$ has a red digit $r_i$ and a blue digit $b_i$ written on it.</p><p>We arrange all $n$ cards in random order from left to right, with all permutations of $1, \ldots, n$ having the same probability. We then read all red digits on the cards from left to right, and obtain an integer $R$. In the same way, we read all blue digits and obtain an integer $B$. When reading a number, leading zeros can be ignored. If all digits in a number are zeros, then the number is equal to $0$. Below is an illustration of a possible rearrangement of three cards, and how $R$ and $B$ can be found.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://0YGFUY5R.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Two players, Red and Blue, are involved in a bet. Red bets that after the shuffle $R &gt; B$, and Blue bets that $R &lt; B$. If in the end $R = B$, the bet results in a draw, and neither player wins.</p><p>Determine, which of the two players is more likely (has higher probability) to win the bet, or that their chances are equal. Refer to the Note section for a formal discussion of comparing probabilities.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 100$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Descriptions of $T$ test cases follow.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $T$ ($1 \leq T \leq 100$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Descriptions of $T$ test cases follow. Each test case description starts with a line containing a single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of cards.</p><p>The following line contains a string of $n$ digits $r_1, \ldots, r_n$&nbsp;— red digits on cards $1, \ldots, n$ respectively.</p><p>The following line contains a string of $n$ digits $b_1, \ldots, b_n$&nbsp;— blue digits on cards $1, \ldots, n$ respectively.</p><p>Note that digits in the same line are not separated with any delimiters.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $T$ answers for the test cases in order, one per line.</p><p>If Red has a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly</span> higher change to win, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">RED</span>".</p><p>If Blue has a <span class="tex-font-style-bf">strictly</span> higher change to win, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">BLUE</span>".</p><p>If both players are equally likely to win, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">EQUAL</span>".</p><p>Note that all answers are <span class="tex-font-style-bf">case-sensitive</span>.</p>

## Note

<p>Formally, let $n_R$ be the number of permutations of cards $1, \ldots, n$ such that the resulting numbers $R$ and $B$ satisfy $R &gt; B$. Similarly, let $n_B$ be the number of permutations such that $R &lt; B$. If $n_R &gt; n_B$, you should print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">RED</span>". If $n_R &lt; n_B$, you should print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">BLUE</span>". If $n_R = n_B$, print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">EQUAL</span>".</p><p>In the first sample case, $R = 777$ and $B = 111$ regardless of the card order, thus Red always wins.</p><p>In the second sample case, there are two card orders when Red wins, and four card orders when Blue wins:</p><ul><li> order $1, 2, 3$: $314 &gt; 159$;</li><li> order $1, 3, 2$: $341 &gt; 195$;</li><li> order $2, 1, 3$: $134 &lt; 519$;</li><li> order $2, 3, 1$: $143 &lt; 591$;</li><li> order $3, 1, 2$: $431 &lt; 915$;</li><li> order $3, 2, 1$: $413 &lt; 951$.</li></ul><p>Since $R &lt; B$ is more frequent, the answer is "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">BLUE</span>".</p><p>In the third sample case, $R = B$ regardless of the card order, thus the bet is always a draw, and both Red and Blue have zero chance to win.</p>
