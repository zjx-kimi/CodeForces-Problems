## Description

<div><p>Polycarp knows that if the sum of the digits of a number is divisible by $3$, then the number itself is divisible by $3$. He assumes that the numbers, the sum of the digits of which is divisible by $4$, are also somewhat interesting. Thus, he considers a positive integer $n$ interesting if its sum of digits is divisible by $4$.</p><p>Help Polycarp find the nearest larger or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. That is, find the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line in the input contains an integer $a$ ($1 \le a \le 1000$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. In other words, print the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line in the input contains an integer $a$ ($1 \le a \le 1000$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print the nearest greater or equal interesting number for the given number $a$. In other words, print the interesting number $n$ such that $n \ge a$ and $n$ is minimal.</p>
