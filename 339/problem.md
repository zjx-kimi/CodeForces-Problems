## Description

<div><p>A $10 \times 10$ target is made out of five "rings" as shown. Each ring has a different point value: the outermost ring&nbsp;— 1 point, the next ring&nbsp;— 2 points, ..., the center ring&nbsp;— 5 points.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://ZZDC6tvC.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Vlad fired several arrows at the target. Help him determine how many points he got.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $\texttt{X}$ (representing an arrow) or $\texttt{.}$ (representing no arrow).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the total number of points of the arrows.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The input consists of multiple test cases. The first line of the input contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>Each test case consists of 10 lines, each containing 10 characters. Each character in the grid is either $\texttt{X}$ (representing an arrow) or $\texttt{.}$ (representing no arrow).</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the total number of points of the arrows.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, there are three arrows on the outer ring worth 1 point each, two arrows on the ring worth 3 points each, and two arrows on the ring worth 4 points each. The total score is $3 \times 1 + 2 \times 3 + 2 \times 4 = 17$. </p><p>In the second test case, there aren't any arrows, so the score is $0$.</p>
