## Description

<div><p>You have a permutation: an array $a = [a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n]$ of distinct integers from $1$ to $n$. The length of the permutation $n$ is odd.</p><p>Consider the following algorithm of sorting the permutation in increasing order.</p><p>A helper procedure of the algorithm, $f(i)$, takes a single argument $i$ ($1 \le i \le n-1$) and does the following. If $a_i &gt; a_{i+1}$, the values of $a_i$ and $a_{i+1}$ are exchanged. Otherwise, the permutation doesn't change.</p><p>The algorithm consists of iterations, numbered with consecutive integers starting with $1$. On the $i$-th iteration, the algorithm does the following: </p><ul> <li> if $i$ is odd, call $f(1), f(3), \ldots, f(n - 2)$; </li><li> if $i$ is even, call $f(2), f(4), \ldots, f(n - 1)$. </li></ul><p>It can be proven that after a finite number of iterations the permutation will be sorted in increasing order.</p><p>After how many iterations will this happen for the first time?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 999$; $n$ is odd)&nbsp;— the length of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the permutation itself. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $999$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case print the number of iterations after which the permutation will become sorted in increasing order for the first time.</p><p>If the given permutation is already sorted, print $0$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \le t \le 100$). Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 999$; $n$ is odd)&nbsp;— the length of the permutation.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the permutation itself. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $999$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case print the number of iterations after which the permutation will become sorted in increasing order for the first time.</p><p>If the given permutation is already sorted, print $0$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, the permutation will be changing as follows: </p><ul> <li> after the $1$-st iteration: $[2, 3, 1]$; </li><li> after the $2$-nd iteration: $[2, 1, 3]$; </li><li> after the $3$-rd iteration: $[1, 2, 3]$. </li></ul><p>In the second test case, the permutation will be changing as follows: </p><ul> <li> after the $1$-st iteration: $[4, 5, 1, 7, 2, 3, 6]$; </li><li> after the $2$-nd iteration: $[4, 1, 5, 2, 7, 3, 6]$; </li><li> after the $3$-rd iteration: $[1, 4, 2, 5, 3, 7, 6]$; </li><li> after the $4$-th iteration: $[1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 6, 7]$; </li><li> after the $5$-th iteration: $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]$. </li></ul><p>In the third test case, the permutation is already sorted and the answer is $0$.</p>
