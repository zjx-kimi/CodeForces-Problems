## Description

<div><p>You are given a positive integer $D$. Let's build the following graph from it: </p><ul> <li> each vertex is a divisor of $D$ (not necessarily prime, $1$ and $D$ itself are also included); </li><li> two vertices $x$ and $y$ ($x &gt; y$) have an undirected edge between them if $x$ is divisible by $y$ and $\frac x y$ is a prime; </li><li> the weight of an edge is the number of divisors of $x$ that are not divisors of $y$. </li></ul><p>For example, here is the graph for $D=12$: </p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://wGLY2yJy.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Edge $(4,12)$ has weight $3$ because $12$ has divisors $[1,2,3,4,6,12]$ and $4$ has divisors $[1,2,4]$. Thus, there are $3$ divisors of $12$ that are not divisors of $4$ — $[3,6,12]$.</p><p>There is no edge between $3$ and $2$ because $3$ is not divisible by $2$. There is no edge between $12$ and $3$ because $\frac{12}{3}=4$ is not a prime.</p><p>Let the length of the path between some vertices $v$ and $u$ in the graph be the total weight of edges on it. For example, path $[(1, 2), (2, 6), (6, 12), (12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 6)]$ has length $1+2+2+3+1+2=11$. The empty path has length $0$.</p><p>So the shortest path between two vertices $v$ and $u$ is the path that has the minimal possible length.</p><p>Two paths $a$ and $b$ are different if there is either a different number of edges in them or there is a position $i$ such that $a_i$ and $b_i$ are different edges.</p><p>You are given $q$ queries of the following form: </p><ul> <li> $v$ $u$ — calculate the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">number of the shortest paths</span> between vertices $v$ and $u$. </li></ul><p>The answer for each query might be large so print it modulo $998244353$.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $D$ ($1 \le D \le 10^{15}$) — the number the graph is built from.</p><p>The second line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le D$). It is guaranteed that $D$ is divisible by both $v$ and $u$ (both $v$ and $u$ are divisors of $D$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $q$ integers — for each query output the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">number of the shortest paths</span> between the two given vertices modulo $998244353$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $D$ ($1 \le D \le 10^{15}$) — the number the graph is built from.</p><p>The second line contains a single integer $q$ ($1 \le q \le 3 \cdot 10^5$) — the number of queries.</p><p>Each of the next $q$ lines contains two integers $v$ and $u$ ($1 \le v, u \le D$). It is guaranteed that $D$ is divisible by both $v$ and $u$ (both $v$ and $u$ are divisors of $D$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print $q$ integers — for each query output the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">number of the shortest paths</span> between the two given vertices modulo $998244353$.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first example: </p><ul> <li> The first query is only the empty path — length $0$; </li><li> The second query are paths $[(12, 4), (4, 2), (2, 1)]$ (length $3+1+1=5$), $[(12, 6), (6, 2), (2, 1)]$ (length $2+2+1=5$) and $[(12, 6), (6, 3), (3, 1)]$ (length $2+2+1=5$). </li><li> The third query is only the path $[(3, 1), (1, 2), (2, 4)]$ (length $1+1+1=3$). </li></ul>
