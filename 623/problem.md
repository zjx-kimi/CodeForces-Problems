## Description

<div><p>Two friends, Alisa and Yuki, planted a tree with $n$ vertices in their garden. A tree is an undirected graph without cycles, loops, or multiple edges. Each edge in this tree has a length of $k$. Initially, vertex $1$ is the root of the tree.</p><p>Alisa and Yuki are growing the tree not just for fun, they want to sell it. The <span class="tex-font-style-it">cost</span> of the tree is defined as the maximum distance from the root to a vertex among all vertices of the tree. The distance between two vertices $u$ and $v$ is the sum of the lengths of the edges on the path from $u$ to $v$.</p><p>The girls took a course in gardening, so they know how to modify the tree. Alisa and Yuki can spend $c$ coins to shift the root of the tree to one of the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">neighbors of the current root</span>. This operation can be performed any number of times (possibly zero). Note that the structure of the tree is left unchanged; the only change is which vertex is the root.</p><p>The friends want to sell the tree with the maximum <span class="tex-font-style-it">profit</span>. The <span class="tex-font-style-it">profit</span> is defined as the difference between the <span class="tex-font-style-it">cost</span> of the tree and the total cost of operations. <span class="tex-font-style-bf">The profit is <span class="tex-font-style-it">cost</span> of the tree minus the total cost of operations</span>.</p><p>Help the girls and find the maximum <span class="tex-font-style-it">profit</span> they can get by applying operations to the tree any number of times (possibly zero).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. </p><p>The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains integers $n$, $k$, $c$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k, c \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree, the length of each edge, and the cost of the operation.</p><p>The next $n - 1$ lines of the test case contain pairs of integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the edges of the graph.

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains one integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases. </p><p>The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains integers $n$, $k$, $c$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$; $1 \le k, c \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of vertices in the tree, the length of each edge, and the cost of the operation.</p><p>The next $n - 1$ lines of the test case contain pairs of integers $u_i$, $v_i$ ($1 \le u_i, v_i \le n$)&nbsp;— the edges of the graph. These edges form a tree.</p><p>The sum of the values of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, output a single integer&nbsp;— the maximum <span class="tex-font-style-it">profit</span> that Yuki and Alisa can get.</p>
