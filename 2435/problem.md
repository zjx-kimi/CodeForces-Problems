## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ squares drawn from left to right on the floor. The $i$-th square has three integers $p_i,a_i,b_i$, written on it. The sequence $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ forms a permutation.</p><p>Each round you will start from the leftmost square $1$ and jump to the right. If you are now on the $i$-th square, you can do one of the following two operations:</p><ol> <li> Jump to the $i+1$-th square and pay the cost $a_i$. If $i=n$, then you can end the round and pay the cost $a_i$. </li><li> Jump to the $j$-th square and pay the cost $b_i$, where $j$ is the leftmost square that satisfies $j &gt; i, p_j &gt; p_i$. If there is no such $j$ then you can end the round and pay the cost $b_i$. </li></ol><p>There are $q$ rounds in the game. To make the game more difficult, you need to maintain a square set $S$ (initially it is empty). You <span class="tex-font-style-bf">must</span> pass through these squares during the round (other squares can also be passed through). The square set $S$ for the $i$-th round is obtained by adding or removing a square from the square set for the $(i-1)$-th round. </p><p>For each round find the minimum cost you should pay to end it.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($1\le n,q\le 2 \cdot 10^5$) &nbsp;— the number of squares and the number of rounds.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ ($1\le p_i\le n$). It is guaranteed that the sequence $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ forms a permutation.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($-10^9\le a_i\le 10^9$).</p><p>The fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n$ ($-10^9\le b_i\le 10^9$).</p><p>Then $q$ lines follow, $i$-th of them contains a single integer $x_i$ ($1\le x_i\le n$). If $x_i$ was in the set $S$ on the $(i-1)$-th round you should remove it, otherwise, you should add it.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $q$ lines, each of them should contain a single integer &nbsp;— the minimum cost you should pay to end the corresponding round.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$, $q$ ($1\le n,q\le 2 \cdot 10^5$) &nbsp;— the number of squares and the number of rounds.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ distinct integers $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ ($1\le p_i\le n$). It is guaranteed that the sequence $p_1,p_2,\dots,p_n$ forms a permutation.</p><p>The third line contains $n$ integers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($-10^9\le a_i\le 10^9$).</p><p>The fourth line contains $n$ integers $b_1,b_2,\dots,b_n$ ($-10^9\le b_i\le 10^9$).</p><p>Then $q$ lines follow, $i$-th of them contains a single integer $x_i$ ($1\le x_i\le n$). If $x_i$ was in the set $S$ on the $(i-1)$-th round you should remove it, otherwise, you should add it.</p>

## Output

## Note

<p>Let's consider the character $T$ as the end of a round. Then we can draw two graphs for the first and the second test.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://al2oDpOX.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://G2gaq4Yg.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the first round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is $\{1\}$. The path you can use is $1\to 3\to T$ and its cost is $6$.</p><p>In the second round of the first test, the set that you must pass through is $\{1,2\}$. The path you can use is $1\to 2\to 3\to T$ and its cost is $8$.</p>
