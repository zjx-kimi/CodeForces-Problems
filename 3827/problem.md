## Description

<div><p>Airports often use moving walkways to help you walking big distances faster. Each such walkway has some speed that effectively increases your speed. You can stand on such a walkway and let it move you, or you could also walk and then your effective speed is your walking speed plus walkway's speed.</p><p>Limak wants to get from point $0$ to point $L$ on a straight line. There are $n$ disjoint walkways in between. The $i$-th walkway is described by two integers $x_i$ and $y_i$ and a real value $s_i$. The $i$-th walkway starts at $x_i$, ends at $y_i$ and has speed $s_i$. </p><p>Every walkway is located inside the segment $[0, L]$ and no two walkways have positive intersection. However, they can touch by endpoints.</p><p>Limak needs to decide how to distribute his energy. For example, it might make more sense to stand somewhere (or to walk slowly) to then have a lot of energy to walk faster.</p><p>Limak's initial energy is $0$ and it must never drop below that value. At any moment, he can walk with any speed $v$ in the interval $[0, 2]$ and it will cost him $v$ energy per second, but he continuously recovers energy with speed of $1$ energy per second. So, when he walks with speed $v$, his energy increases by $(1-v)$. Note that negative value would mean losing energy.</p><p>In particular, he can walk with speed $1$ and this won't change his energy at all, while walking with speed $0.77$ effectively gives him $0.23$ energy per second.</p><p>Limak can choose his speed arbitrarily (any real value in interval $[0, 2]$) at every moment of time (including the moments when he is located on non-integer positions). Everything is continuous (non-discrete).</p><p>What is the fastest time Limak can get from $0$ to $L$?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains integers $n$ and $L$ ($1 \le n \le 200\,000$, $1 \le L \le 10^9$), the number of walkways and the distance to walk.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and real value $s_i$ ($0 \le x_i &lt; y_i \le L$, $0.1 \le s_i \le 10.0$). The value $s_i$ is given with at most $9$ digits after decimal point.</p><p>It's guaranteed, that no two walkways have a positive intersection. The walkways are listed from left to right. That is, $y_i \le x_{i + 1}$ for $1 \le i \le n - 1$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print one real value, the fastest possible time to reach $L$.

## Input

<p>The first line contains integers $n$ and $L$ ($1 \le n \le 200\,000$, $1 \le L \le 10^9$), the number of walkways and the distance to walk.</p><p>Each of the next $n$ lines contains integers $x_i$, $y_i$ and real value $s_i$ ($0 \le x_i &lt; y_i \le L$, $0.1 \le s_i \le 10.0$). The value $s_i$ is given with at most $9$ digits after decimal point.</p><p>It's guaranteed, that no two walkways have a positive intersection. The walkways are listed from left to right.

## Note

<p>The drawings show the first two examples. In the first one, there is a walkway from $0$ to $2$ with speed $2.0$ and Limak wants to get to point $5$. The second example has a walkway from $2$ to $4$ with speed $0.91$.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://WLBKMJ8k.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>In the first example, one of optimal strategies is as follows.</p><ul> <li> Get from $0$ to $2$ by standing still on the walkway. It moves you with speed $2$ so it takes $1$ second and you save up $1$ energy. </li><li> Get from $2$ to $4$ by walking with max speed $2$ for next $1$ second. It takes $1$ second again and the energy drops to $0$. </li><li> Get from $4$ to $5$ by walking with speed $1$. It takes $1$ second and the energy stays constant at the value $0$. </li></ul><p>The total time is $1 + 1 + 1 = 3$.</p>
