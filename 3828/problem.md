## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">This is a harder version of the problem. In this version $q \le 200\,000$.</span></p><p>A sequence of integers is called <span class="tex-font-style-it">nice</span> if its elements are arranged in blocks like in $[3, 3, 3, 4, 1, 1]$. Formally, if two elements are equal, everything in between must also be equal.</p><p>Let's define <span class="tex-font-style-it">difficulty</span> of a sequence as a minimum possible number of elements to change to get a nice sequence. However, if you change at least one element of value $x$ to value $y$, you must also change all other elements of value $x$ into $y$ as well. For example, for $[3, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2]$ it isn't allowed to change first $1$ to $3$ and second $1$ to $2$. You need to leave $1$'s untouched or change them to the same value.</p><p>You are given a sequence of integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ and $q$ updates.</p><p>Each update is of form "$i$ $x$"&nbsp;â€” change $a_i$ to $x$. Updates are not independent (the change stays for the future).</p><p>Print the difficulty of the initial sequence and of the sequence after every update.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 200\,000$, $0 \le q \le 200\,000$), the length of the sequence and the number of the updates.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 200\,000$), the initial sequence.</p><p>Each of the following $q$ lines contains integers $i_t$ and $x_t$ ($1 \le i_t \le n$, $1 \le x_t \le 200\,000$), the position and the new value for this position.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $q+1$ integers, the answer for the initial sequence and the answer after every update.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains integers $n$ and $q$ ($1 \le n \le 200\,000$, $0 \le q \le 200\,000$), the length of the sequence and the number of the updates.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$ ($1 \le a_i \le 200\,000$), the initial sequence.</p><p>Each of the following $q$ lines contains integers $i_t$ and $x_t$ ($1 \le i_t \le n$, $1 \le x_t \le 200\,000$), the position and the new value for this position.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $q+1$ integers, the answer for the initial sequence and the answer after every update.</p>
