## Description

<div><p>Polycarp is very fond of playing the game Minesweeper. Recently he found a similar game and there are such rules.</p><p>There are mines on the field, for each the coordinates of its location are known ($x_i, y_i$). Each mine has a lifetime in seconds, after which it will explode. After the explosion, the mine also detonates all mines vertically and horizontally at a distance of $k$ (two perpendicular lines). As a result, we get an explosion on the field in the form of a "plus" symbol ('<span class="tex-font-style-bf">+</span>'). Thus, one explosion can cause new explosions, and so on.</p><p>Also, Polycarp can detonate anyone mine every second, starting from zero seconds. After that, a chain reaction of explosions also takes place. Mines explode <span class="tex-font-style-bf">instantly</span> and also <span class="tex-font-style-bf">instantly</span> detonate other mines according to the rules described above.</p><p>Polycarp wants to set a new record and asks you to help him calculate in what minimum number of seconds all mines can be detonated.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test.</p><p>An empty line is written in front of each test suite.</p><p>Next comes a line that contains integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which describes the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the $i$-th mine and the time until its explosion ($-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$, $0 \le timer \le 10^9$). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print $t$ lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data &nbsp;— the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line of the input contains an integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases in the test.</p><p>An empty line is written in front of each test suite.</p><p>Next comes a line that contains integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $0 \le k \le 10^9$) — the number of mines and the distance that hit by mines during the explosion, respectively.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow, the $i$-th of which describes the $x$ and $y$ coordinates of the $i$-th mine and the time until its explosion ($-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9$, $0 \le timer \le 10^9$). It is guaranteed that all mines have different coordinates.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of the values $n$ over all test cases in the test does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>Print $t$ lines, each of the lines must contain the answer to the corresponding set of input data &nbsp;— the minimum number of seconds it takes to explode all the mines.</p>
