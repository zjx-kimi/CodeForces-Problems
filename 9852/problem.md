<div><p>You're given a string of lower-case Latin letters. Your task is to find the length of its longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice. These occurrences can overlap (see sample test 2).</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first input line contains the string. It's guaranteed, that the string is non-empty, consists of lower-case Latin letters, and its length doesn't exceed 100.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Output one number — length of the longest substring that can be met in the string at least twice.</p></div>
