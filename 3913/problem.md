## Description

<div><p>There are $n$ segments drawn on a plane; the $i$-th segment connects two points ($x_{i, 1}$, $y_{i, 1}$) and ($x_{i, 2}$, $y_{i, 2}$). Each segment is non-degenerate, and is either horizontal or vertical — formally, for every $i \in [1, n]$ either $x_{i, 1} = x_{i, 2}$ or $y_{i, 1} = y_{i, 2}$ (but only one of these conditions holds). Only segments of different types may intersect: no pair of horizontal segments shares any common points, and no pair of vertical segments shares any common points.</p><p>We say that four segments having indices $h_1$, $h_2$, $v_1$ and $v_2$ such that $h_1 &lt; h_2$ and $v_1 &lt; v_2$ form a rectangle if the following conditions hold:</p><ul> <li> segments $h_1$ and $h_2$ are horizontal; </li><li> segments $v_1$ and $v_2$ are vertical; </li><li> segment $h_1$ intersects with segment $v_1$; </li><li> segment $h_2$ intersects with segment $v_1$; </li><li> segment $h_1$ intersects with segment $v_2$; </li><li> segment $h_2$ intersects with segment $v_2$. </li></ul><p>Please calculate the number of ways to choose four segments so they form a rectangle.

## Input

<p>The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 5000$) — the number of segments.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th line contains four integers $x_{i, 1}$, $y_{i, 1}$, $x_{i, 2}$ and $y_{i, 2}$ denoting the endpoints of the $i$-th segment. All coordinates of the endpoints are in the range $[-5000, 5000]$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that each segment is non-degenerate and is either horizontal or vertical. Furthermore, if two segments share a common point, one of these segments is horizontal, and another one is vertical.</p>
