## Input

<p>The first line contains two integers $n$ and $k$ ($1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5$, $2 \le k \le 10^9$)&nbsp;— the number of chains and the minimum number of white vertices a tree should have to have a value.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers $l_1, l_2, \dots, l_n$ ($3 \le l_i \le 2 \cdot 10^5$)&nbsp;— the lengths of the chains.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer. If there is no way to build a tree with at least $k$ white vertices, then print <span class="tex-font-style-tt">-1</span>. Otherwise, print the minimum value the tree can have.</p>

<center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://g2zA1aZn.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>You are allowed to not use all the chains, so it's optimal to only use chain of length $4$ in the second example.</p>
