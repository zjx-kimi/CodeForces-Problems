After almost 3 years, it's time for Ivy to awake her bonded sister, Vanessa.</p><p>The system inside A.R.C.'s Library core can be considered as an undirected graph with infinite number of processing nodes, numbered with all positive integers ($1, 2, 3, \ldots$). The node with a number $x$ ($x &gt; 1$), is directly connected with a node with number $\frac{x}{f(x)}$, with $f(x)$ being the lowest prime divisor of $x$.</p><p>Vanessa's mind is divided into $n$ fragments.

## Input

<p>The first line contains an integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^6$)&nbsp;— number of fragments of Vanessa's mind.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ integers: $k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_n$ ($0 \le k_i \le 5000$), denoting the nodes where fragments of Vanessa's mind are located: the $i$-th fragment is at the node with a number $k_i!$.</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single integer, denoting the minimal sum of path from every fragment to the node with the emotion samples (a.k.a. node $P$).</p><p>As a reminder, if there are multiple fragments at the same node, the distance from that node to $P$ needs to be counted multiple times as well.</p>

## Note

<p>Considering the first $24$ nodes of the system, the node network will look as follows (the nodes $1!$, $2!$, $3!$, $4!$ are drawn bold):</p><p><img class="tex-graphics" src="file://LwtrlcSR.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"></p><p>For the first example, Ivy will place the emotion samples at the node $1$. From here:</p><ul> <li> The distance from Vanessa's first fragment to the node $1$ is $1$. </li><li> The distance from Vanessa's second fragment to the node $1$ is $0$. </li><li> The distance from Vanessa's third fragment to the node $1$ is $4$. </li></ul><p>The total length is $5$.</p><p>For the second example, the assembly node will be $6$. From here:</p><ul> <li> The distance from Vanessa's first fragment to the node $6$ is $0$. </li><li> The distance from Vanessa's second fragment to the node $6$ is $2$. </li><li> The distance from Vanessa's third fragment to the node $6$ is $2$. </li><li> The distance from Vanessa's fourth fragment to the node $6$ is again $2$. </li></ul><p>The total path length is $6$.</p>
