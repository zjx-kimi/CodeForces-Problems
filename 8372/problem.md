## Description

<div><p>Xenia the beginner mathematician is a third year student at elementary school. She is now learning the addition operation.</p><p>The teacher has written down the sum of multiple numbers. Pupils should calculate the sum. To make the calculation easier, the sum only contains numbers 1, 2 and 3. Still, that isn't enough for Xenia. She is only beginning to count, so she can calculate a sum only if the summands follow in non-decreasing order. For example, she can't calculate sum 1+3+2+1 but she can calculate sums 1+1+2 and 3+3.</p><p>You've got the sum that was written on the board. Rearrange the summans and print the sum in such a way that Xenia can calculate the sum.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a non-empty string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> — the sum Xenia needs to count. String <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">+</span>". Besides, string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> is at most 100 characters long.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print the new sum that Xenia can count.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a non-empty string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> — the sum Xenia needs to count. String <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> contains no spaces. It only contains digits and characters "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">+</span>". Besides, string <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> is a correct sum of numbers 1, 2 and 3. String <span class="tex-span"><i>s</i></span> is at most 100 characters long.</p>
