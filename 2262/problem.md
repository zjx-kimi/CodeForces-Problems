## Description

<div><p>You are given a tree with $n$ nodes, numerated from $0$ to $n-1$. For each $k$ between $0$ and $n$, inclusive, you have to count the number of unordered pairs $(u,v)$, $u \neq v$, such that the <span class="tex-font-style-bf">MEX</span> of all the node labels in the shortest path from $u$ to $v$ (including end points) is $k$.</p><p>The <span class="tex-font-style-bf">MEX</span> of a sequence of integers is the smallest non-negative integer that does not belong to the sequence.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$).</p><p>The next $n-1$ lines of each test case describe the tree that has to be constructed. These lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($0 \le u,v \le n-1$) denoting an edge between $u$ and $v$ ($u \neq v$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p><p>It is also guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>For each test case, print $n+1$ integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX of all the node labels in that path is $k$ for each $k$ from $0$ to $n$.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \le t \le 10^4$) — the number of test cases. </p><p>The first line of each test case contains a single integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^{5}$).</p><p>The next $n-1$ lines of each test case describe the tree that has to be constructed. These lines contain two integers $u$ and $v$ ($0 \le u,v \le n-1$) denoting an edge between $u$ and $v$ ($u \neq v$).</p><p>It is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.</p><p>It is also guaranteed that the sum of $n$ for all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^{5}$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print $n+1$ integers: the number of paths in the tree, such that the MEX of all the node labels in that path is $k$ for each $k$ from $0$ to $n$.</p>
