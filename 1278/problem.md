## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 1000$). The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains an integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 2000$) — the number of vertices in the tree.</p><p>Then $n$ lines follow. The $i$-th of these lines contains a string $good_i$ of length $n+1-i$ consisting of <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span> and <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>. If the segment $[i,i+j-1]$ is good then the $j$-th character of $good_i$ is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">1</span>, otherwise $j$-th character of $good_i$ is <span class="tex-font-style-tt">0</span>.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the there is at least one tree consistent with the given data. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2000$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print $n-1$ lines describing the tree you recover. </p><p>The $i$-th line should contain two integers $u_i$ and $v_i$ ($1 \leq u_i,v_i \leq n$), denoting an edge between vertices $u_i$ and $v_i$.</p><p>If there are multiple solutions, print any.</p>
