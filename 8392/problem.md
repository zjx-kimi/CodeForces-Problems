## Description

<div><p>Gerald has <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> younger brothers and their number happens to be even. One day he bought <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i><sup class="upper-index">2</sup></span> candy bags. One bag has one candy, one bag has two candies, one bag has three candies and so on. In fact, for each integer <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i><sup class="upper-index">2</sup></span> he has exactly one bag with <span class="tex-span"><i>k</i></span> candies. </p><p>Help him give <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> bags of candies to each brother so that all brothers got the same number of candies.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The single line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> is even, <span class="tex-span">2 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of Gerald's brothers.</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Let's assume that Gerald indexes his brothers with numbers from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>.

Naturally, all these numbers should be distinct and be within limits from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i><sup class="upper-index">2</sup></span>. You can print the numbers in the lines in any order. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the solution exists at the given limits.</p></div>

## Input

<p>The single line contains a single integer <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> (<span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> is even, <span class="tex-span">2 ≤ <i>n</i> ≤ 100</span>) — the number of Gerald's brothers.</p>

## Output

<p>Let's assume that Gerald indexes his brothers with numbers from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span>. You need to print <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> lines, on the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th line print <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i></span> integers — the numbers of candies in the bags for the <span class="tex-span"><i>i</i></span>-th brother. Naturally, all these numbers should be distinct and be within limits from <span class="tex-span">1</span> to <span class="tex-span"><i>n</i><sup class="upper-index">2</sup></span>. You can print the numbers in the lines in any order. </p><p>It is guaranteed that the solution exists at the given limits.</p>

## Note

<p>The sample shows Gerald's actions if he has two brothers. In this case, his bags contain 1, 2, 3 and 4 candies. He can give the bags with 1 and 4 candies to one brother and the bags with 2 and 3 to the other brother.</p>
