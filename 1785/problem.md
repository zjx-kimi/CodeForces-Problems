## Description

<div><p>Circular land is an $2n \times 2n$ grid. Rows of this grid are numbered by integers from $1$ to $2n$ from top to bottom and columns of this grid are numbered by integers from $1$ to $2n$ from left to right. The cell $(x, y)$ is the cell on the intersection of row $x$ and column $y$ for $1 \leq x \leq 2n$ and $1 \leq y \leq 2n$.</p><p>There are $n^2$ of your friends in the top left corner of the grid. That is, in each cell $(x, y)$ with $1 \leq x, y \leq n$ there is exactly one friend. Some of the other cells are covered with snow.</p><p>Your friends want to get to the bottom right corner of the grid. For this in each cell $(x, y)$ with $n+1 \leq x, y \leq 2n$ there should be exactly one friend. It doesn't matter in what cell each of friends will be.</p><p>You have decided to help your friends to get to the bottom right corner of the grid.</p><p>For this, you can give instructions of the following types: </p><ul> <li> You select a row $x$. All friends in this row should move to the next cell in this row. That is, friend from the cell $(x, y)$ with $1 \leq y &lt; 2n$ will move to the cell $(x, y + 1)$ and friend from the cell $(x, 2n)$ will move to the cell $(x, 1)$. </li><li> You select a row $x$. All friends in this row should move to the previous cell in this row. That is, friend from the cell $(x, y)$ with $1 &lt; y \leq 2n$ will move to the cell $(x, y - 1)$ and friend from the cell $(x, 1)$ will move to the cell $(x, 2n)$. </li><li> You select a column $y$. All friends in this column should move to the next cell in this column. That is, friend from the cell $(x, y)$ with $1 \leq x &lt; 2n$ will move to the cell $(x + 1, y)$ and friend from the cell $(2n, y)$ will move to the cell $(1, y)$. </li><li> You select a column $y$. All friends in this column should move to the previous cell in this column. That is, friend from the cell $(x, y)$ with $1 &lt; x \leq 2n$ will move to the cell $(x - 1, y)$ and friend from the cell $(1, y)$ will move to the cell $(2n, y)$. </li></ul><p>Note how friends on the grid border behave in these instructions.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://OgIk0raY.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> <span class="tex-font-size-small">Example of applying the third operation to the second column.

## Input

<p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 100$)&nbsp;— the number of test cases.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains the single integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 250$).</p><p>Each of the next $2n$ lines contains $2n$ integers $c_{i, 1}, c_{i, 2}, \ldots, c_{i, 2n}$ ($0 \leq c_{i, j} \leq 10^9$)&nbsp;— costs of removing snow from cells. If $c_{i, j} = 0$ for some $i, j$ than there is no snow in cell $(i, j)$. Otherwise, cell $(i, j)$ is covered with snow.</p><p>It is guaranteed that $c_{i, j} = 0$ for $1 \leq i, j \leq n$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $250$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case output one integer&nbsp;— the minimal number of coins you should spend.</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case you can remove snow from the cells $(2, 1)$ and $(2, 2)$ for $100$ coins. Then you can give instructions </p><ul> <li> All friends in the first collum should move to the previous cell. After this, your friend will be in the cell $(2, 1)$. </li><li> All friends in the second row should move to the next cell. After this, your friend will be in the cell $(2, 2)$. </li></ul><p>In the second test case you can remove all snow from the columns $3$ and $4$ for $22$ coins. Then you can give instructions </p><ul> <li> All friends in the first row should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the first row should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the second row should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the second row should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the third column should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the third column should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the fourth column should move to the next cell. </li><li> All friends in the fourth column should move to the next cell. </li></ul><p>It can be shown that none of the friends will become ill and that it is impossible to spend less coins.</p>
