## Input

<p>The first line of input contains two integers $n$, $k$ ($2 \leq n \leq 50$, $1 \leq k \leq min(n - 1, 5)$).</p><p>The second line contains $k$ integers $d_1, d_2, \ldots, d_k$ ($1 \leq d_i \leq n$). </p><p>The $i$-th of the next $n - 1$ lines contains $n - i$ integers $w_{i,i+1}, w_{i,i+2}, \ldots, w_{i,n}$ ($1 \leq w_{i,j} \leq 100$): weights of edges $(i,i+1),(i,i+2),\ldots,(i,n)$.</p>

## Output

<p>Print one integer: the minimum weight of a spanning tree under given degree constraints for the first $k$ vertices. </p>
