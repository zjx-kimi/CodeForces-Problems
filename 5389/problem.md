## Description

<div><p>Imp likes his plush toy a lot.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://X4MDDhRG.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Recently, he found a machine that can clone plush toys. Imp knows that if he applies the machine to an original toy, he additionally gets one more original toy and one copy, and if he applies the machine to a copied toy, he gets two additional copies.</p><p>Initially, Imp has only one original toy. He wants to know if it is possible to use machine to get exactly <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> <span class="tex-font-style-bf">copied</span> toys and <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> <span class="tex-font-style-bf">original</span> toys? He can't throw toys away, and he can't apply the machine to a copy if he doesn't currently have any copies.</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">0 ≤ <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>)&nbsp;— the number of copies and the number of original toys Imp wants to get (including the initial one).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", if the desired configuration is possible, and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">No</span>" otherwise.</p><p>You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).</p></div>

## Input

<p>The only line contains two integers <span class="tex-span"><i>x</i></span> and <span class="tex-span"><i>y</i></span> (<span class="tex-span">0 ≤ <i>x</i>, <i>y</i> ≤ 10<sup class="upper-index">9</sup></span>)&nbsp;— the number of copies and the number of original toys Imp wants to get (including the initial one).</p>

## Output

<p>Print "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">Yes</span>", if the desired configuration is possible, and "<span class="tex-font-style-tt">No</span>" otherwise.</p><p>You can print each letter in arbitrary case (upper or lower).</p>





```input1

```




```input3
1000 1001

```

```



## Note

<p>In the first example, Imp has to apply the machine twice to original toys and then twice to copies.</p>
