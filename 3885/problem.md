## Description

<div><p>While sailing on a boat, Inessa noticed a beautiful water lily flower above the lake's surface. She came closer and it turned out that the lily was exactly $H$ centimeters above the water surface. Inessa grabbed the flower and sailed the distance of $L$ centimeters. Exactly at this point the flower touched the water surface.</p><center> <img class="tex-graphics" src="file://VsztsW1N.png" style="max-width: 100.0%;max-height: 100.0%;"> </center><p>Suppose that the lily grows at some point $A$ on the lake bottom, and its stem is always a straight segment with one endpoint at point $A$. Also suppose that initially the flower was exactly above the point $A$, i.e. its stem was vertical. Can you determine the depth of the lake at point $A$?</p></div><div class="input-specification"><p>The only line contains two integers $H$ and $L$ ($1 \le H &lt; L \le 10^{6}$).</p></div><div class="output-specification"><p>Print a single number&nbsp;— the depth of the lake at point $A$. The absolute or relative error should not exceed $10^{-6}$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $A$, and the jury's answer be $B$.

## Input

<p>The only line contains two integers $H$ and $L$ ($1 \le H &lt; L \le 10^{6}$).</p>

## Output

<p>Print a single number&nbsp;— the depth of the lake at point $A$. The absolute or relative error should not exceed $10^{-6}$.</p><p>Formally, let your answer be $A$, and the jury's answer be $B$. Your answer is accepted if and only if $\frac{|A - B|}{\max{(1, |B|)}} \le 10^{-6}$.</p>
