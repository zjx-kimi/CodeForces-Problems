## Description

<div><p><span class="tex-font-style-it">Hemose was shopping with his friends Samez, AhmedZ, AshrafEzz, TheSawan and O_E in Germany.

He wants Samez to sort the array in the non-decreasing order. Since it would be a too easy problem for Samez, Hemose allows Samez to use only the following operation:</p><ul><li><p>Choose indices $i$ and $j$ such that $1 \le i, j \le n$, and $\lvert i - j \rvert \geq x$.

## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $t$ $(1 \leq t \leq 10^5)$. Description of the test cases follows.</p><p>The first line of each test case contains two integers $n$ and $x$ $(1 \leq x \leq n \leq 10^5)$.</p><p>The second line of each test case contains $n$ integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ $(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9)$.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, you should output a single string. </p><p>If Samez can sort the array in non-decreasing order using the operation written above, output "YES" (without quotes). Otherwise, output "NO" (without quotes).</p><p>You can print each letter of "YES" and "NO" in any case (upper or lower).</p>

## Note

<p>In the first test case, you can't do any operations.</p><p>In the second test case, the array is already sorted.</p><p>In the third test case, you can do the operations as follows: </p><ul> <li> $[5,1,2,3,4]$, $swap(a_1,a_3)$ </li><li> $[2,1,5,3,4]$, $swap(a_2,a_5)$ </li><li> $[2,4,5,3,1]$, $swap(a_2,a_4)$ </li><li> $[2,3,5,4,1]$, $swap(a_1,a_5)$ </li><li> $[1,3,5,4,2]$, $swap(a_2,a_5)$ </li><li> $[1,2,5,4,3]$, $swap(a_3,a_5)$ </li><li> $[1,2,3,4,5]$ </li></ul><p>(Here $swap(a_i, a_j)$ refers to swapping elements at positions $i$, $j$).</p>
