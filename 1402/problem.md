## Input

<p>Each test contains multiple test cases. </p><p>The first line contains a single integer $t$ ($1 \leq t \leq 10^3$) — the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.</p><p>For each test case, the first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n\leq 2\cdot 10^5$) — the initial number of tokens.</p><p>The second line contains $n$ intergers $a_1,a_2,\ldots,a_n$ ($1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9$) — the initial magical power of the $n$ tokens.</p><p>It is guaranteed that the sum of $n$ over all test cases does not exceed $2 \cdot 10^5$.</p>

## Output

<p>For each test case, print a single integer — the minimum number of operations Patchouli needs to make all tokens have an <span class="tex-font-style-bf">odd</span> value of magical power.</p><p>It can be shown that under such restrictions the required sequence of operations exists. </p>

## Note

<p>Test case 1:</p><p>$a$ consists solely of odd numbers initially.</p><p>Test case 2:</p><p>Choose the tokens with magical power of $1$ and $2$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[1,3]$, both are odd numbers.</p><p>Test case 3:</p><p>Choose the tokens with magical power of $2$ and $8$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[4,10]$.</p><p>Choose the token with magical power of $10$ and perform Reduction. Now $a=[4,5]$.</p><p>Choose the tokens with magical power of $4$ and $5$ and perform Fusion. Now $a=[9]$, and $9$ is an odd number.</p><p>It can be shown that you can not make all the magical powers <span class="tex-font-style-bf">odd</span> numbers in less than $3$ moves, so the answer is $3$.</p>
